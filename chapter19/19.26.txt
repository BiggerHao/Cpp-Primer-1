Exercise 19.26: Explain these declarations and indicate whether they are legal:

	extern "C" int compute(int *, int);
	extern "C" double compute(double *, double);

By Faisal Saadatmand

The declarations use a linkage directive, extern "C", to export a C++ function
(compute) to be used with C program. The declarations are illegal because the
compute is an overloaded function. The C language does not support function
overloading.
