Exercise 19.24: Explain what happens if we assign a Token object to itself.

By Faisal Saadatmand

copy-assignment operator:
If the tok is a string or Sales_data object, the if statements that check if
the two object have the same discriminant (have the same type of object held by
the union) would take care of the guard against self-assignment. This is so
because placement new expression will never be executed, and therefore, we
would need not worry about an exception being thrown--the Token object is
simply copied to itself. 

move-assignment operator:
If we move an object, however, we must include a guard against self-assignment.
This can be done by enclosing the code in a check that would ignore the to
moving an object to itself. (p. 536-537)
