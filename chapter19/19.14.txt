Exercise 19.14: Is the following code legal? If so, what does it do? If not,
why?

	auto pmf = &Screen::get_cursor;
	pmf = &Screen::get;

By Faisal Saadatmand

The code is legal. It assign the address of a Screen member function, get, to
pmf, which is pointer to a member function of the same type. The type of pmf is
deduced from &Scree::get_cursor. The code is equivalent to:

	// define a pointer to member function and initialize it with get_cursor
	 char (Screen::*pmf)() const = &Screen::get_cursor;
	 // assign get member function to the pointer
	 pmf = &Screen::get;
	
Both get_cursor and get are const member functions that return a char and take
no parameters.
