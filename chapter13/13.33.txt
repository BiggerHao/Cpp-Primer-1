Exercise 13.33: Why is the parameter to the save and remove members of Message
a Folder&? Why didnâ€™t we define that parameter as Folder? Or const Folder&?

By Faisal Saadatmand

Because the we need a pointer to the folder to pass to the insert or erase
operator of the set folders. We achieve that by the use of the address operator
&. Using & with a parameter Folder we will give us a pointer to the temporary
copy of the object passed to save or remove, which has a different address than
the one stored in the set folders. As for const Folder & parameter, it will
yield a pointer with a low-level constant (const *Folder), which means we
cannot remove it because we cannot change the value of what it points to.
