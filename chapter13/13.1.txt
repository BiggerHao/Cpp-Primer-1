Exercise 13.1: What is a copy constructor? When is it used?

By Faisal Saadatmand

A copy constructor is a constructor that defines "what happens when an object is
initialized from another object of the same type." (p.496) It is used whenever copy
initialization is used. Copy initialization happens when
	(1) the an = is used to initialize and object, 
	(2) an object is passed as an argument to a parameter of non-reference type,
	(3) An object is returned from a function that has a non-reference return
		type, and
	(4) the elements in an array or the members of an aggregate class are brace
		initialized. (page 498)
