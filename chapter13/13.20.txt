Exercise 13.20: Explain what happens when we copy, assign, or destroy objects
of our TextQuery and QueryResult classes from ยง 12.3 (p. 484).

By Faisal Saadatmand

For TextQuery, file and wm are copied using their respective class(s) copy
constructors to the left-hand side object, when we copy one object to another
(copy initialize). Wen we assign an object to another, file and wm are assigned
using their respective assign operators to the left-hand side object, when we
assign one object to another (copy initialize). When we destroy an object,
file and wm are destroyed and their resources are freed using their respective
class(s) destructors.

The same happens for the QueryResult members, they are copied, assigned and
destroyed using their class copy constructor, assign operator and destructor
respectively.
