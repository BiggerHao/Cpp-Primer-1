Exercise 13.16: What if the parameter in f were const numbered&?  Does that
change the output? If so, why? What output gets generated?

Only if numbered had a copy constructor that generates a new serial number. In
which case, f's argument is passed by a constant reference. Thus, the output
will be the same serial numbers generated for a, b and c prior the function
call. If f used the synthesized copy constructor then no.
