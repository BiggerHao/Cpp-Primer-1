Exercise 13.56: What would happen if we defined sorted as:

	Foo Foo::sorted() const & {
		Foo ret(*this);
		return ret.sorted();
	}

By Faisal Saadatmand

ret.sorted will cause a indefinite recursive call to Foo sorted() const &,
which would eventually cause a stack overflow. This is so because ret is an
lvalue.
