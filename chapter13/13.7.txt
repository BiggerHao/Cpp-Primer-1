Exercise 13.7: What happens when we assign one StrBlob to another? What about
StrBlobPtrs?

By Faisal Saadatmand

The synthesized copy-assignment operator is used for both StrBlob and
StrBlobPtr.

In the case of StrBlob, memory is allocated for the member data in the
left-hand object and then the value (content) of data in the right-hand object
is copied to it using copy-assignment operator.

In the case of StrBlobPtr, the same thing happens to copy wptr. curr is
allocated on the stack, so it is copied simply by using the assignment
operator.

In both cases, a reference to the left-hand object is returned.
