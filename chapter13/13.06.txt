Exercise 13.6: What is a copy-assignment operator?  When is this operator used?
What does the synthesized copy-assignment operator do? When is it synthesized?

By Faisal Saadatmand

A copy-assignment operator is a class member function that defines "what
happens when we assign an object of a class type to another object of the same
class type." (p. 496) In other words, it is an operation by which a class
controls how its objects are assigned to one another.

The function is an overloaded operator and is used whenever its objects are
copy-assigned to one another using the = operator.

The synthesized copy-assignment operator is a compiler generated version. Its
job is to "assigns each nonstatic member of the right-hand object to the
left-hand object using the copy assignment operator for the type of that
member." (p.  499) It returns a reference to its left-hand object. Note that
"for some classes the synthesized version disallow assignment." (p. 499). 

If a class does not define a copy-assignment operator, the compiler will
provide the synthesized version for it.
