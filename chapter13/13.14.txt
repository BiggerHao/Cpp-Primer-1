Exercise 13.14: Assume that numbered is a class with a default constructor that
generates a unique serial number for each object, which is stored in a data
member named mysn. Assuming numbered uses the synthesized copy-control members
and given the following function:

	void f (numbered s) { cout << s.mysn << endl; }

what output does the following code produce?

	numbered a, b = a, c = b;
	f(a); f(b); f(c);

By Faisal Saadatmand

The code prints the unique serial number generated for the object a three
times. That is because only a declaration uses the class constructor. The other
two declarations b = a and c = b use the synthesized copy constructor to
initialize the members of the class. Thus, the value mysn in those classes is
copied, rather than uniquely generated, during the copying procedure.

Example out put (assuming mysn starts at 0):
1
1
1
