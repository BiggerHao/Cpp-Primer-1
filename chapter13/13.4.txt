Exercise 13.4: Assuming Point is a class type with a public copy constructor,
identify each use of the copy constructor in this program fragment:

	Point global;
	Point foo_bar(Point arg)
	{
		Point local = arg, *heap = new Point(global);
		*heap = local;
		Point pa[ 4 ] = { local, *heap };
		return *heap;
	}

By Faisal Saadatmand

The copy constructor is used in the following statements:

	Point foo_bar(Point arg):

arg is passed by value, which means it is copy initialized.

	Point local = arg,

local is copy initialized from arg.

	*heap = new Point(global);

heap is a pointer to Point that is copy initialized from the new expression.
Essentially, the pointer returned from new is used to copy initialized local
(copied to local).

	Point pa[ 4 ] = { local, *heap };

pa is an array of 4 elements of type Point that is brace initialized. Copy
constructor is used to copy initialized pa from the braced list.

	return *heap;

foo_bar returns a non-reference value, the copy constructor is used to
initialize a copy of the returned value *heap.
