Exercise 13.25: Assume we want to define a version of StrBlob that acts like a
value.  Also assume that we want to continue to use a shared_ptr so that our
StrBlobPtr class can still use a weak_ptr to the vector. Your revised class
will need a copy constructor and copy-assignment operator but will not need a
destructor. Explain what the copy constructor and copy-assignment operators
must do. Explain why the class does not need a destructor.

By Faisal Saadatmand

The synthesized constructor would suffice because it would call the shared_ptr
and weak_ptr destructor to free the those objects' resources. The same would
happen for the containers and their elements.
