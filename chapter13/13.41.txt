Exercise 13.41: Why did we use postfix increment in the call to construct
inside push_back? What would happen if it used the prefix increment?

By Faisal Saadatmand

Because first_free points to one past the last element in StrVec, which is the
beginning the unconstructed memory in the vector's allocated block.  If we had
used the prefix increment, we would leave a gap in the block after the first
push_back operation, and first_free would always point to the last element,
causing that element to be inaccessible to the algorithms implemented in the
class member functions, with exception of push_back.
