Exercise 13.3: What happens when we copy a StrBlob? What about StrBlobPtrs?

By Faisal Saadatamnd

The synthesized copy constructor is used for both StrBlob and StrBlobPtrs.

In the case of StrBlob, memory is allocated for data in the left-hand object,
which is then directly initialized by the content of data of the right-hand
object.

In the case of the StrBlob, the same thing happens with wptr, but since curr is
a built-in class, it is copied directly.
