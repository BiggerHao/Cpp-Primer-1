Exercise 13.32: Would the pointerlike version of HasPtr benefit from defining a
swap function? If so, what is the benefit? If not, why not?

By Faisal Saadatmand

No, a swap function would be redundant in a pointerlike version of HasPtr,
because swaping two pointers objects does not involve copying.
