Exercise 13.21: Do you think the TextQuery and QueryResult classes need to
define their own versions of the copy-control members? If so, why? If not, why
If not, why not?  Implement whichever copy-control operations you think these
classes require.

By Faisal Saadatmand

TextQuery and QueryResult do not require a defined destructor, for the
resources of their members are released by the members' class type destructors.
Therefore--in keeping with the rule of thumb--they do not require a copy
constructor or an assignment operator either.
