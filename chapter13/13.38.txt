Exercise 13.38: We did not use copy and swap to define the Message assignment
operator. Why do you suppose this is so?

By Faisal Saadatmand

The copy assignment operator inserts and erases pointers in containers (sets)
across class objects. Using copy and swap in this context would not make sense,
for it involves more work: an extra call to the copy constructor (because we
are passing the Message by value) and an extra call to the destructor. This
seems to cancel out any gains we would have benefited from swap, not to mention
that the defined swap uses the std::swap version, which swaps values not
pointers.
