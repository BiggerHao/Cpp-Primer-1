Exercise 13.15: Assume numbered has a copy constructor that generates a new
serial number. Does that change the output of the calls in the previous
exercise? If so, why?  What output gets generated?

Yes, because every time a class object is copy initialized the copy constructor
is invoked to will generated a new unique serial number for the left-hand
object. So both b and c will have their own unique serial number, which is
distinct from a. Furthermore, arguments are passed to f by value. This means
that a, b and c are copied again, and the output will be a printout of unique
serial numbers different from the ones generated prior to the function call. 

Example out put (assuming mysn starts at 0):
2
3
4
