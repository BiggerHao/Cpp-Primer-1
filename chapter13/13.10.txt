Exercise 13.10: What happens when a StrBlob object is destroyed? What about a
StrBlobPtr?

By Faisal Saadatmand

A destructor for the class is synthesized in both cases. StrBlob's member data
is shared_ptr that points to a vector of strings. The vector elements are
destroyed using its destructor, which in turn calls the string destructor for
each elements. The allocated memory for the shared_ptr is deallocated by its
class destructor if the reference count is zero.

The same happens in the case of StrBlobPtr, except since the wptr is a weak_ptr
the allocated memory is nor released by the the weak_ptr class destructor and
no destructor is called on curr since it is a built-in type (usually unsigned
long).
