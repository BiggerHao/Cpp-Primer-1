Exercise 7.18: What is encapsulation? Why is it useful?

By Faisal

Encapsulation is the separation of interface and implementation in an abstract
data type. (p.254) We can use access specifiers to enforce encapsulations,
which enables us to hide the implementation part of the code from the user of
the class. It is useful because it simplifies the utility of an object of an
abstract data type (a class). The user of the class need not to worry about the
complexities of the implementation in order use the class. Moreover, it  allows
us to protect the member's data from public access, i.e. they can be interacted
with only through a defined interface.
