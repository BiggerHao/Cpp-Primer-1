Exercise 7.48: Assuming the Sales_data constructors are not explicit, what
operations happen during the following definitions

	string null_isbn("9-999-99999-9");
	Sales_data item1(null_isbn);
	Sales_data item2("9-999-99999-9");

What happens if the Sales_data constructors are explicit?

By Faisal Saadatmand

In the first call, Sales_data uses the string constructor to create an object
item1 with values: "9-999-99999-9", 0, 0. Implicit conversion is used to
convert the string null_isbn to Sales_data class-type. In the second call, the
same thing takes place, except the implicit conversion is from a string literal
to a temp string to Sales_data class-type.

If the Sales_data constructors were explicit, the implicit conversion would
still take place since we are using direct initialization as opposed to copying
(with =) and only one type-class conversion.
