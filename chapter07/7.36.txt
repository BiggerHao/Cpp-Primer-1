Exercise 7.36: The following initializer is in error. Identify and fix the
problem.

	struct X {
		X (int i, int j): base(i), rem(base % j) { }
		int rem, base;
	};

By Faisal Saadatmand

The order of members initialization in the constructor's initializer list does
not match the order in which the members are declared: rem is initialized first
witht the undefined value of base.

Correction:

	struct X {
		X (int i, int j): base(i), rem(base % j) { }
		int base, rem; // reverse the order
	};
