Exercise 7.47: Explain whether the Sales_data constructor that takes a string
should be explicit. What are the benefits of making the constructor explicit?
What are the drawbacks?

By Faisal Saadatmand

It depends on how we think the users of the class would use the data. (p.295)
If an implicit conversion facilitate better uses of the class without creating
undesirable effect then the answer is no, it should not be explicit, otherwise
yes. In the case of Sales_data, it makes little difference either way.

Benefits:
- Enforce code predictability by eliminating surprising and undesirable effects
  of an implicit conversion.
- Conversions can still take place through explicit definition.
- Enforcing the use of direct form of initialization
- Syntax requirement reflects a slightly lower-level of the language that exposes its 
  inner mechanics. This could also be a drawback. 

Drawbacks
- Adds stricter rules to initializations, which could complicate syntax. 
- only single argument constructors can be explicit.
