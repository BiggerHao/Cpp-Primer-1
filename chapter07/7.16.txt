Exercise 7.16: What, if any, are the constraints on where and how often an
access specifier may appear inside a class definition? What kinds of members
should be defined after a public specifier? What kinds should be private?

By Faisal Saadatmand

There are no constrains on  where and how often an access specifier may appear
inside a class definition. The only rule is that "each access specifier
specifies the access level of the succeeding members." (p. 269)  If members are
defined before the first access specifier (i.e. without an access specifier),
they will be assigned a private specifier by default. Subsequent specifiers, if
exist, would observe the same rule.

Members that are part of the interface are defined after the public specifier,
while those that are part of the implementation are defined after the private
specifier.
