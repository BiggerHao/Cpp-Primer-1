Exercise 7.46: Which, if any, of the following statements are untrue? Why?

	(a) A class must provide at least one constructor.
	(b) A default constructor is a constructor with an empty parameter list.
	(c) If there are no meaningful default values for a class, the class should
		not provide a default constructor.
	(d) If a class does not define a default constructor, the compiler
		generates one that initializes each data member to the default value of
		its associated type.

(a) False. If a class does not provide a constructor the compile will generate
	a synthesized default constructor for it.
(b) True
(c) False. Every class should have a default constructor regardless of the
	meaningfulness of its members' default values. If the synthesized default
	constructor would suffice than there would be no need in declaring one
	explicitly.
(d) True, but also, if present, it initializes the members from their
	in-class initializers first.
