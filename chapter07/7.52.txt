Exercise 7.52: Using our first version of Sales_data from ยง 2.6.1 (p. 72),
explain the following initialization. Identify and fix any problems.

	Sales_data item = {"978-0590353403", 25, 15.99};

by Faisal Saadatmand

struct Sales_data {
	std::string bookNo;
	unsigned units_sold = 0;
	double revenue = 0.0;
};

This is an aggregate class initialization. It uses a braced list initializers.
The third initializer is the price of each book sold, not the revenue. The
proper way to initialize this aggregate class object, the user must do so as
follows:

 Sales_data item = {"978-059-03534-03", 25, 15.99 * 25)
