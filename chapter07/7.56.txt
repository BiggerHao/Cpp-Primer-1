Exercise 7.56: What is a static class member? What are the advantages of static
members? How do they differ from ordinary members?

We can think of a static member as member of a given class itself (associated
with the class), rather than a member of the class object (associated with the
object). As such, it is created and initialized once, and shared by objects of
the same class.

There are advantages to having a static member. It improves efficiency when
only one shared variable would suffice for all the created objects. More
important, it enables us to create and maintain a single, persistent variable
through which all objects are related, for example a counter.

A static member differs from an ordinary member, in the way it is declared and
defined, and the way it is accessed. Moreover, a static data member cannot have
an in-class initialization, except if it is a const of integral type or a
constant expression of literal type. (p. 302) Finally, unlike ordinary members,
a static member can be used as a default for argument member functions and can
have an incomplete type, for example it can be used in a class of the same
type. (p. 303)
