Exercise 7.25: Can Screen safely rely on the default versions of copy and
assignment? If so, why? If not, why not?

By Faisal Saadatmand

Yes, because Screen uses the standard library string, which takes care of the
dynamic memory allocation requirements. Had Screen used a raw array and a char
*, the default synthesized versions of copy and assignment would not have been
adequate.
