Exercise 7.30: It is legal but redundant to refer to members through the this
pointer. Discus the pros and cons of explicitly using the this pointer to
access members.

By Faisal Saadatmand

One advantage of using an explicit this is that it reminds the class creator
that class members are being accessed and changed through a pointer though
function, and therefore, the return value must be a reference (or at least a
pointer) to the class object. This is especially important if the object of the
class will be used in sequence of function calls through the member operator.
See exercise 7.29. The disadvantage, of course, it adds redundant verbosity to
the code--it is much more natural to say, cursor = 0 than this->cursor = 0.
