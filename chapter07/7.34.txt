Exercise 7.34: What would happen if we put the typedef of pos in the Screen
class on page 285 as the last line in the class?

By Faisal Saadatmand

int height;

Class Screen {
public:
	void dummy_fcn(pos height) {
	cursor = width * height;
	}
private:
	pos cursor = 0;
	pos height = 0, width = 0;
	typedef std::string::size_type pos;
};

The program will be in error: the name pos is used before its declaration and
there is no declaration in the outer scope either.
