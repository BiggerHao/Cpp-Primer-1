Exercise 7.10: What does the condition in the following if statement do?

	if (read(read(cin, data1), data2))

By Faisal Saadatmand

It evaluates the return value of the nested call to the read function, which
reads two sets of data into the data1 and data2. If either call returns 0, i.e.
no data (or data match) was read from the input stream, the if statemant would
fail.
