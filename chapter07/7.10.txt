Exercise 7.10: What does the condition in the following if statement do?

	if (read(read(cin, data1), data2))

By Faisal Saadatmand

It evaluates the return value of the nested call to the read function, which
reads two sets of data into data1 and data2. If either call returns 0, i.e.
no data (or no match) was read from the input stream, the if statement would
fail.

This works because read returns a reference to the input stream. When cin
fails, the state of cin.fail() holds true and we will not be able to write to
the same input stream, which is carried over to the second read function
through the returned reference. See reference manual on cin for more
clarification.
