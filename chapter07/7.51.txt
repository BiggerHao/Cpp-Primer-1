Exercise 7.51: Why do you think vector defines its single-argument constructor
as explicit, but string does not?

By Faisal Saadatmand


Because the initializing a vector with the constructor that takes size as a
parameter could lead to surprising and undesired effects if implicit conversion
were to be allowed. For example, consider the following different
initializations:

	int x = 10;
	vecotr<double> vec(x);    // create a vec with 10 elements
	vecotr<double> vec = x;   // copies 10 to vector

making the constructor explicit, eliminates this confusion.

In the case of string, however, we could benefit from a converting constructor
(i.e. implicit class-type conversion) in the case we initialized a string from
a C-style string literal (const char * type). Consider the following example:

	 // implicit conversion to library string
	string s1("this is a string");
	string s2(s1);   // copy s1 to s1; no confusion 

	string s1 = "this is a string";
	string s2 = s1;
