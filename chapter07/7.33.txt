Exercise 7.33: What would happen if we gave Screen a size member defined as
follows? Fix any problems you identify.

	pos Screen::size() const
	{
		return height * width;
	}

By Faisal Saadatmand

Even if size() is declared with in Screen, we would still get a compile error,
because pos is not in scope--it is seen by the compiler before the class name.
Correction:

Screen::pos Screen::size() const
{
	return height * width;
}
