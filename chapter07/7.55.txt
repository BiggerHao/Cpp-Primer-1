Exercise 7.55: Is the Data class from ยง 7.5.5 (p. 298) a literal class? If not,
why not? If so, explain why it is literal.

by Faisal Saadatmand

struct Data {
	int ival;
	string s;
};

No, because the string s member is not of literal type. An aggregate class is a
literal if all of its members are of literal type. (p.299)
