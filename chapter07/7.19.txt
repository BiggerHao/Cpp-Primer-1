Exercise 7.19: Indicate which members of your Person class you would declare
as public and which you would declare as private. Explain your choice.

By Faisal Saadatmand

All the constructors and the member functions should be public. The
constructors because they need to be accessible whenever an object is created
and the function members because they are the means by which the user of the
class is able to interface with the class, for example to fetch the values of the members. The members, such as pName and pAddress should be private.
