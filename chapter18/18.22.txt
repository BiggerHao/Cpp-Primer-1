Exercise 18.22: Given the following class hierarchy, in which each class
defines a default constructor:

	class A { ... };
	class B : public A { ... };
	class C : public B { ... };
	class X { ... };
	class Y { ... };
	class Z : public X, public Y { ... };
	class MI : public C, public Z { ... };

what is the order of constructor execution for the following definition?

	MI mi;

By Faisal Saadatmand

Two rules govern initializations of members of classes related by multiple
inheritance:

1) "The order in which base classes are constructed depends on the order in
which they appear in the derivation list." (p.804)

2) members initialization starts with the ultimate base class and ends with the
most-derived class.

In case of the above definition, mi is an object of type MI. MI inherts from C
and Z. According to 1, C is initialized before Z. Given that both are derived
classes, 2 applies to them. Thus, the order is as follows:

A, B, C, X, Y, Z
