Exercise 18.15: Explain the differences between using declarations and
directives.

By Faisal Saadatmand

Using declarations and directives "allow us to use the unqualified form of a
namespace name." (p.793) The key differance between the two is in the scope
they modify or extend. The "names intrudoced using declarations obey normal
scope rules" (ibid.) while those introduced in a using directive appear "into
the nearest scope that contains both the namespace itself and the using
directive." (p. 794)
