Exercise 18.13: When might you use an unnamed namespace?

By Faisal Saadatmand

We use an unnamed namespace when we need an object to have a static lifetime,
i.e. to lasts until the end of the program, and to be local to a particular
file scope. The use of an unnamed namespace is recommended over the use of the
deprecated static keyword inherited from the C language. (p.792)
