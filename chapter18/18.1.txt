Exercise 18.1: What is the type of the exception object in the following throws?

	(a) range_error r("error"); (b) exception *p = &r;
		throw r;					throw *p;

What would happen if the throw in (b) were written as throw p?

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) range_error
(b) exception; The static type of the throw expression determines the exception
	object. (774-775) In this case, the static type is exception.

If (b) were written as throw p, the type would be "pointer to a exception" (i.e
exception *). This is a bad idea, since it could potentially cause memory
management errors. (p. 774)
