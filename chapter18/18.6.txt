Exercise 18.6: Given the following exception types and catch clauses, write a
throw expression that creates an exception object that can be caught by each
catch clause:

	(a) class exceptionType { };
		catch(exceptionType *pet) { }
	(b) catch(...) { }
	(c) typedef int EXCPTYPE;
		catch(EXCPTYPE) { }

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) exceptionType *p;
	throw p;
(b) a throw of any type will be caught by catch(...)
(c) int i; EXCPTYPE ii;
	throw i;
	or
	throw ii;
