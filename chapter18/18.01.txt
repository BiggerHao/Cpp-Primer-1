Exercise 18.1: What is the type of the exception object in the following throws?

	(a) range_error r("error"); (b) exception *p = &r;
		throw r;					throw *p;

What would happen if the throw in (b) were written as throw p?

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) range_error
(b) exception; The static type of the throw expression determines the exception
	object. (774-775) In this case, the static type is exception.

If b were written as throw p, the type would be "pointer to an exception" (i.e.
exception *). This is could potentially cause memory leak if r were a local
object/variable and the exception were not handled within the local scope of r.
