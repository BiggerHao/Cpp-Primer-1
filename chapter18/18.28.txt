Exercise 18.28: Given the following class hierarchy, which inherited members
can be accessed without qualification from within the VMI class? Which require
qualification?  Explain your reasoning.

	struct Base {
		void bar(int); // public by default
	protected:
		int ival;
	};
	struct Derived1 : virtual public Base {
		void bar(char); // public by default
		void foo(char);
	protected:
		char cval;
	};
	struct Derived2 : virtual public Base {
		void foo(int); // public by default
	protected:
		int ival;
		char cval;
	};
	class VMI : public Derived1, public Derived2 { };

By Faisal Saadatmand

Reguire no qualification:
ival; Derived2::ival overrides Base::ival, and thus, takes  precedence over it.
bar; Derived1::bar overrides Base:bar, and thus, takes precedence over it.

Require qualification:
cval; ambiguous--appears in both Derived1 and Derived2
foo; ambiguous--appears in both Derived1 and Derived2
