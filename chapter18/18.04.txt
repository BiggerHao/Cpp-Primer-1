Exercise 18.4: Looking ahead to the inheritance hierarchy in Figure 18.1 (p.
783), ex- plain whatâ€™s wrong with the following try block. Correct it.

	try {
	// use of the C++ standard library
	} catch(exception) {
	// ...
	} catch(const runtime_error &re) {
	// ...
	} catch(overflow_error eobj) { /* ... */ }

By Faisal Saadatmand

Catch clauses are matched in the order they appear. Therefore, to use the
exceptions from the aforementioned inheritance hierarchy, the catch clauses
must be ordered, such that the handler to a derived class must occur before a
catch for its base class.

	try {
	// use of the C++ standard library
	} catch(overflow_error eobj) {
	// ..
	} catch(const runtime_error &re) {
	// ...
	} catch(exception) { 
	// ...
	}
