Exercise 8.3: What causes the following while to terminate?

	while (cin >> i) /* ... */

by Faisal Saadatmand

When the stream encounters a system level failure, an IO failure or the stream
reaches the end-of-file. Each of these errors turn on the following bits
respectively: badbit, failbit and enfbit. Given that the failbit is also turned
on when either the badbit or the eofbit is truned on, this while loop test for
the condition !cin.fail(). That is, it terminates when !cin.fail() is evaluated
false.
