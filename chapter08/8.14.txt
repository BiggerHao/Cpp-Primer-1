Exercise 8.14: Why did we declare entry and nums as const auto &?

By Faisal Saadatmand

Because the intention was to read the data from the vectors without
manipulating them in the original object. Thus, the use of a reference to cont
in the for-range loop makes sense, for it avoids unnecessary copying of objects
to the local variables entry and nums at each iteration.
