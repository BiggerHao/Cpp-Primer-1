Exercise 11.5: Explain the difference between a map and a set. When might you
use one or the other?

By Faisal Saadatmand

Both are associative containers. map is an implementation of a hashtable data
structure and set is an implementation of a binary search tree. Accordingly,
each has a different mechanism for storing and accessing data.

In a map the elements are made up of a key-value pairs. The value is mapped to
the key. The key serves as an index into the map and as such is used to access
the data in the structure. We use a map when we need to pair a value or
multiple values with a key, such as in the case of a dictionary lookup.

The element of a set contains only a key. In other words, the key is the value.
When we need to access data in a set, we use the key to traverse the set
(tree).  We use a set when we need to sort a set of data according to a given
criteria, especially when the sorting and storing is done as the data is begin
received. The chraracteritic of a binary search tree allows quick, and
efficient, access to the data. A good example of a set usage is word counting
or spell check programs.
