Exercise 11.30: Explain the meaning of the operand pos.first->second used in
the output expression of the final program in this section.

By Faisal Saadatmand

pos.first->second is the value part of the element found at the postion denoted
by first iterator in the pair pos (it is the key's position)..

The variable pos is a pair of iterators. to access the first members of the
pair we use pos.first. Since first is an iterator, we need to dereferce it to
get the value of that element with the subexpression pos.first->.  The element
itself is pair (element of a map); therefore, the value can be fetched with
pos.firs->second.
