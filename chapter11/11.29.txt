Exercise 11.29: What do upper_bound, lower_bound, and equal_range return when
you pass them a key that is not in the container?

By Faisal Saadatmand

lower_bound returns an iterator that referees to the first instance of the key
and upper_bound to one element past that key. If the element does not exists in
the container both will return equal iterators, which refers to the point at
which the key can be inserted into the container without disturbing its order.
Combining both operations yields an iterator range. (p 438) In addition, either
operation could return an of-the-end iterator. If the key we are looking for is
greater than any key in the container, than upper_bound returns an off-the-end
iterator. "If the key is not present and is larger than any key in the
container", then lower_bound will also return the off-the-end iterator. (439)

equal_range returns a pair of iterators representing a range. Essentially, it
combines the operation of both lower_bound and upper_bound and returns a pair
of iterators that correspond to the result of calling those two operations. For
example, if the key is present, the first iterator in the pair will refer to
the lower bound and the second to the upper bound of the key, and so on.
