Exercise 11.29: What do upper_bound, lower_bound, and equal_range return when
you pass them a key that is not in the container?

By Faisal Saadatmand

lower_bound and upper_bound will return the same iterator, which is the first
point at which the key can be inserted. If the key we're looking for is greater
than any key in the container, both lower_bound and upper_bound will return an
off-the-end iterator.

equal_range would return a pair of iterators, whose members are c.end().
