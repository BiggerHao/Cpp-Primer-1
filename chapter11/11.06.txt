Exercise 11.6: Explain the difference between a set and a list. When might you use
one or the other?

By Faisal Saadatmand

A list is a sequential container while a set is an associative container. Both
do not support random data access, because their elements are not stored
contiguously in memory, and therefore, they support most of the container
operations with some exceptions, for example they have no subscript operator.
The key difference between the two is in the way the is data stored and
accessed. Elements in a list are accessed sequentially by their position in the
container. This means a linear search is used to locate an element in a list.
A set, on the other hand, uses keys to access data. Element in a list are
sorted and stored in a binary search. The key is used to locate the position of
an element within the tree. This mean we can use a binary search algorithm to
access a its element. Though insertion is slower in a set, the access speed is
faster than a list.

When dealing with a large set of data where access speed or multiple values for
a given key is a factor, a set is preferred. If, on the other hand, write speed
at any point of the list is important, a list is used.
