Exercise 11.6: Explain the difference between a set and a list. When might you use
one or the other?

By Faisal Saadatmand

A list is a sequential container while a set is an associative container. Both
do not support random data access, because their elements are not stored
contiguously in memory, and therefore, they support most of the container
operations with some exceptions, for example no subscript operator. The key
difference between the two, is that elements in a list have no keys. They are
accessed sequentially by their position in the container. A set elements
contain keys. In addition to allowing faster access to the data, a key enable
us to have multiple values for the same key. When dealing with a large set of
data where access speed or multiple values for a given key is a factor, a set
is preferred.
