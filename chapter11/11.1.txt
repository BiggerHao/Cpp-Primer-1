Exercise 11.1: Describe the differences between a map and a vector.

By Faisal Saadatmand

A vector is a sequential container. Its elements are stored and accessed
sequentially by their position in the container. A map is an associative
container. Its elements are stored and retrieved by a key-value pair. Another
way of looking at the difference conceptually is that both are temple
containers; however, a vector is an implementation of a dynamic array (i.e. a
resizable arrays),  while a map is an implementation of a binary search tree in
which the key is the node name and the value is data field in th node.
