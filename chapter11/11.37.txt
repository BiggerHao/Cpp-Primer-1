Exercise 11.37: What are the advantages of an unordered container as compared
to the ordered version of that container? What are the advantages of the
ordered version?

By Faisal Saadatmand

The unordered container doesn't have the cost of maintaining the data ordered,
and as such, is most useful when there is no obvious ordering relationship
among the elements being stored. (p.443) Computing the hash and finding the
bucket are fast operations; however, key collisions resolution and finding a
key in a bucket are slow operations. The ordered versions are usually easier to
implement and typically faster in practice. One should usually the ordered
version unless the key type is inherently unordered or performance testing
reveals a clear advantage of using the hash solution.
