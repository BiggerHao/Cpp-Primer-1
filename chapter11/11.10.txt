Exercise 11.10: Could we define a map from vector<int>::iterator to int?
What about from list<int>::iterator to int? In each case, if not, why not?

By Faisal Saadatmand

from vector<int>::iterator to int

Yes, because a vector's iterator is a random-access iterator (p. 412), which
means it supports the < operator, and therefore, it could be sorted (and
stored) in binary tree data structure.

from list<int>::iterator to int

No, because a list's elements are not stored contiguously in memory, and
accordingly, its iterator is bidirectional iterator (p. 412) that lacks the
relational operators <.
