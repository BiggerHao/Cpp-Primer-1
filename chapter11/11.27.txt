Exercise 11.27: What kinds of problems would you use count to solve? When might
you use find instead?

By Faisal Saadatmand

count is used to count how many elements that have the same key in a container.
This makes sense with containers that hold multiple keys. find is used to find
the first instance of a key in a container. We can combine count and find to
iterate through all the occurrences of a certain key. 

If we only wanted to find if a certain key exists within a container, it is
best to use find for multikey containers, as it does less work. For unique key
containers it does not matter if we used find or count. One benefit of using
find over count is that it returns an iterator to the first occurrence of the
element we are looking for, which could be used to perform further operation.
