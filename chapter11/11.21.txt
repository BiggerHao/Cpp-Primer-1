Exercise 11.21: Assuming word_count is a map from string to size_t and word is
a string, explain the following loop:

	while (cin >> word)
		++word_count.insert({word, 0}).first->second;

By Faisal Saadatmand

The loop takes a word from the standard input stream and increments its value
in the map regardless of the success of the insertion operation. Put simply, it
counts the number of words.

{word, 0} is a value_type, which is pair of string and int.

word_count.insert({word, 0}) inserts the pair into word_count. Returns a pair
of string and bool.

word_count.insert({word, 0}).first is the first object of the pair returned by
the insert operation, which is an iterator to the map element. The bool part
is ignored.

word_count.insert({word, 0}).first->second dereference the value of the second
element denoted by the map iterator, which is the value part of the map element
pair.

++word_count.insert({word, 0}).first->second increment that value.
