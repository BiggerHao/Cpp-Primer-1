/*
 * Exercise 11.20: Rewrite the word-counting program from ยง 11.1 (p. 421) to
 * use insert instead of subscripting. Which program do you think is easier to
 * write and read? Explain your reasoning.
 *
 * By Faisal Saadatmand
 *
 * Answer: the subscript version seems easier. There is less to deal with. The
 * insert version, requires an iterator of type pair and a test of the
 * returned value of the insert operation which is a pair of the container's
 * key type and a bool.  Moreover, the insertion through the iterator also
 * requires two levels of indirections, into the pair and the map iterator.
