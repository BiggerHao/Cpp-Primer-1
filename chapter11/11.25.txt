Exercise 11.25: Contrast the following program with the one in the previous exercise

	vector<int> v;
	v[0] = 1;

By Faisal Saadatmand

It define v as a vector of int. v is an empty vector, which means it is default
initialized. Unlike a map, we cannot add elements to a vector through the
subscript operation; thus, v[0] would not work. We must use the push_back
operation or include the size of v in the definition, vector<int> v(10).
