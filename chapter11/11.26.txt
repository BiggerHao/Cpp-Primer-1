Exercise 11.26: What type can be used to subscript a map? What type does the
subscript operator return? Give a concrete exampleâ€”that is, define a map and
then write the types that can be used to subscript the map and the type that
would be returned from the subscript operator.

By Faisal Saadatmand

key_type is used to subscript a map
mapped_type is the return value of the subscript operator

	map<string, list<int>> m;  // definition of m
	string                     // type to subscript m
	list<int>                  // return value of subscript operator
