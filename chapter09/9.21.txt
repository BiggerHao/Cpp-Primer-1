Exercise 9.21: Explain how the loop from page 345 that used the return from
insert to add elements to a list would work if we inserted into a vector
instead.

by Faisal Saadatmand

vector<string> svec;
auto iter = svec.begin();
while (cin >> word)
	iter = svec.insert(iter, word);

At each iteration of the loop, word is inserted before iter and then iter is
updated to point to the position of the newly inserted element. Since that iter
starts at the beginning of the vector and that each insertion happens at a
position ahead of iter, the vector grows backwards, and therefore, the elements
are inserted in reveres order. This resembles the behaviour of the push_front
operation, which a vector lacks.
