Exercise 9.40: If the program in the previous exercise reads 256 words, what is
its likely capacity after it is resized? What if it reads 512? 1,000? 1,048?

by Faisal Saadatmand

At 256 words its capacity would not change, and it would remain the same after
it is resized as well, 1024.

At 512 words its capacity would not change, and it would remain the same after
resize as well, 1024.

At 1,000 words its capacity would not change, and it would be 1,500 or more
after it is resized.

At 1,048 its capacity would change to 1,048 or more. After it is resized, the
capacity will depend on how much memory was reallocated previously. If more
than 1572 was reallocated, then the capacity would remain the same, otherwise
it would be 1572 or more.
