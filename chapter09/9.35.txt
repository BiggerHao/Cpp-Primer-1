Exercise 9.35: Explain the difference between a vectorâ€™s capacity and its size.

by Faisal Saadatmand

A vector's size is the number of elements it currently holds, while its
capacity is how many elements it could hold according to its allocated memory.
If the size is potentially to exceed the capacity as a result of operations
performed by the user, or a call to resize or reserve is made with a value that
exceeds the current capacity the vector reallocates, and thereby, increases its
capacity to accommodate the new size.  How much more memory is reallocated is
implementation dependent.
