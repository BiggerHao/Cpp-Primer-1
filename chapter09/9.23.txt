Exercise 9.23: In the first program in this section on page 346, what would the
values of val, val2, val3, and val4 be if c.size() is 1?

by Faisal Saadatmand

	if (!c.empty()) {
		auto val = *c.begin(), val2 = c.front();	
		auto last = c.end();
		auto val3 = *(--last);
		auto val4 = c.back();
	}

If c.size() is 1, then val = val2 = val3 = val4, which are equal to the first
element in c.
