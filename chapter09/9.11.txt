Exercise 9.11: Show an example of each of the six ways to create and initialize
a vector. Explain what values each vector contains.

by Faisal Saadatmand

(1) Default constructor. v1 is uninitialized; empty vector

		vector<int> v1;

(2) Copying one vector to another. v1 contains 5 elements, list initialized.
	v2 is a copy of v2.
	
	vector<int> v1{5, 6, 9, 18, 32};
	vector<int> v2(v1); // equivalent to vector<int> v2 = v1;

(3) Copying from a list initialized vector to another vector.

	(a) v1 contains 5 elements that are list initialized

		vector<int> v1{5, 6, 9, 18, 32};
		// equivalent to v1 = {5, 6, 9, 18, 32};

	(b) v1 contains 10 elements that are list initialized, the rest are value
		initialized

		vector<int> v1(10){5, 6, 9, 18, 32};
		// equivalent to vector<int> v1(10) = {5, 6, 9, 18, 32};

(4) Iterators constructor: Copying a range denoted by iterators. v2 is a copy
	of v1. v3 is copy of v1 excluding the first and last elements.

		vector<int> v1{5, 6, 9, 18, 32};
		vector<int> v2(v1.cbegin(), v1.cend());
		vector<int> v3(v1.cbegin() + 1, v1.cend() - 1);

(5) Constructor that takes size. v1 contains 10 elements that are default
	initialized.

		vector<int> v1(10);

(6) Constructor that takes and an object value. v1 contains 10 elements, each
	is set to the int 5

		vector<int> vec(10, 5);
