Exercise 9.3: What are the constraints on the iterators that form iterator
ranges?

by Faisal Saadatmand

A pair of iterators, begin and end, forms a range if
- They refer to elements of, or one past the end of, the same container, and
- It is possible to reach end by repeatedly incrementing begin. In other words,
  end must not precede begin. (p.331)
