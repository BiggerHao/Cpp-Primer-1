Exercise 9.6: What is wrong with the following program? How might you correct
it?
	list<int> lst1;
	list<int>::iterator iter1 = lst1.begin(),
	iter2 = lst1.end();
	while (iter1 < iter2) /* ... */

by Faisal Saadatmand

The condition of the while loop terminates at the last element of the
container, rather than at one past the last element. This makes the range
exclude the last element from the body of the loop: we get [begin, end - 1)
rather than [begin, end)

Correction:

	list<int> lst1;
	list<int>::iterator iter1 = lst1.begin(),
	iter2 = lst1.end();
	while (iter1 != iter2) /* ... */
