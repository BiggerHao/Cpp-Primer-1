Exercise 9.37: Why donâ€™t list or array have a capacity member?

by Faisal Saadatmand

An array is not resizeable, which essentially means its size is its "capacity".
a list does not need to reallocate. Memory allocation is in a list
implementation is non-contiguous, and therefore, adding or removing an elements
from a list does not require for the entire list to be reallocate. The newly
added or removed element is linked or removed from the list by manipulating
pointers.
