Exercise 9.39: Explain what the following program fragment does:

	vector<string> svec;
	svec.reserve(1024);
	string word;
	while (cin >> word)
		svec.push_back(word);
	svec.resize(svec.size() + svec.size() / 2);

by Faisal Saadatmand

The fragment defines an empty vector of strings and resrve 1024 (strings)
capacity for it. It then pushes a string at a time into the vector from the
standard input stream until there is not more input. finally, it resizes the
vector to add 50% more elements to the it. They are value initialized.
