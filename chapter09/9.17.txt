Exercise 9.17: Assuming c1 and c2 are containers, what (if any) constraints
does the following usage place on the types of c1 and c2?

	if (c1 < c2)

by Faisal Saadatmand

The container and element types of c1 and c2 must be an exact match. Moreover,
the relational operator < has to be defined for the element type in definition
of both c1 and c2.
