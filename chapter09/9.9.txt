Exercise 9.9: What is the difference between the begin and cbegin functions?

by Faisal Saadatmand

The function begin returns an iterator of type iterator, while cbegin returns
an iterator of type const_iterator. However, begin has an overloaded version
that is a const function member that also returns a const_iterator depending on
the constness of the member it is being called on.
