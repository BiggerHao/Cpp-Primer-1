Exercise 9.32: In the program on page 354 would it be legal to write the call
to insert as follows? If not, why not?

	iter = vi.insert(iter, *iter++);

by Faisal Saadatmand

Yes, but we must be aware that this iter that we are incrementing (after the
dereferencing) is a copy of the outer scope iter--it is a copy being passed to
the function insert. It goes out of scope and gets destroys once insert has
finished its work. As such, it has no side effect on the rest of the program.
We would still need to increment iter twice after insert.
