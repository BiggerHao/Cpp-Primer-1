Exercise 9.29: Given that vec holds 25 elements, what does vec.resize(100) do?
What if we next wrote vec.resize(10)?

by Faisal Saadatmand

vec.resize(100) adds 75 elements to vec, all of which are value initialized.
Invoking vec.resize(10) next would shrink the vec by 90 elements, their value
is the ordinal value before the resize operations.
