Exercise 9.29: Given that vec holds 25 elements, what does vec.resize(100) do?
What if we next wrote vec.resize(10)?

By Faisal Saadatmand

vec.resize(100) would add 75 elements to vec, all of which are value
initialized. (p. 98) Invoking vec.resize(10) next would erase 90 elements from
the back of vec. The remaining 10 elements would have the original value of the
first 10 elements before the resize operations.
