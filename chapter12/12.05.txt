Exercise 12.5: We did not make the constructor that takes an initializer_list
explicit (ยง 7.5.4, p. 296). Discuss the pros and cons of this design choice.

By Faisal Saadatmand

TODO: Answer

The constructor takes an initializer_list as an argument, making the
constructor explicit would not allow implicit conversion from a any convertible
class type to an initializer_list. It would also disallow the assignment operator.
