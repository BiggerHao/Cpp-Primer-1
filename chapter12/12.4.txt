Exercise 12.4: In our check function we didnâ€™t check whether i was greater than
zero. Why is it okay to omit that check?

By Faisal Saadatmand

Because i, or data->size(), would never be less than 0: its type is
std::vector<std::string>::size_type, which is an unsigned integer type (usually
size_t).
