Exercise 12.13: What happens if we execute the following code?

	auto sp = make_shared<int>();
	auto p = sp.get();
	delete p;

By Faisal Saadatmand

sp's memory will be deleted, leaving sp as a dangling pointer. Furthermore,
when sp goes out of scope the deconstructor will attempt to free its memory
again, causing an error (corruption of free memory).
