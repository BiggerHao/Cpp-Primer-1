Exercise 12.31: What difference(s) would it make if we used a vector instead of
a set to hold the line numbers? Which approach is better? Why?

By Faisal Saadatmand

Unlike with a set, using a vector would log the line number a word appears on
more than once. For example, if a word appears on a line multiple times, the
vector would have duplicate line numbers. This is advantageous when we would
like to know the occurrence of a word within a text. We could simply retrieve
the size of the vector, which would be inaccurate in the case of a set. A
vector has at least two disadvantage: 1) when we need to print the data, we
would get duplicate lines; 2) the line numbers are not sorted and to sort them
is slower than a set.
