Exercise 2.3: What output will the following code produce?
by Faisal Saadatmand

u2 - u = 32
u - u2 = 4294967264
Here the result will "wrap arround", which will equal to maximum limit of
unsigned int minus 31 (31 instead of 32 to account for bit at 0 position). 

i2 - i = 32
i - i2 = -32

i - u = 0
The result will be promoted to an unsigned int.
u - i = 0
The result will be promoted to an unsigned int.
