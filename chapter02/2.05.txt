Exercise 2.5: Determine the type of each of the following literals. Explain the difference among the literals in each of the four examples:

	(a) 'a', L'a', "a", L"a"
	(b) 10, 10u, 10L, 10uL, 012, 0xC
	(c) 3.14, 3.14f, 3.14L
	(d) 10, 10u, 10., 10e-2

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a)
	'a' 	a character literal.
	L'a' 	a wide character literal. It is a character literal that's been
			overridden by the L (wide character) prefix.
	"a"		a string literal.
	L"a"	a wide character string literal. It is a string literal that's
			been overridden by L (wide character) prefix.
(b)
	10		constant int.
	10u		constant unsigned int. It is a constant int overridden with u (unsigned) suffix. 
	10L		constant long int. It is a constant int overridden with L (long) suffix
	10uL	constant long unsigned. It is a constant int overridden with u and L suffixes.
	012		octal: newline character
	0xC		hexadecimal: newpage character
(c)
	3.14	constant double.
	3.14f	constant float. It is a double overridden with f (float) suffix.
	3.14L	constant long double. It is a double overridden with L (long) suffix.
(d)
	10		constant int
	10u		constant unsigned. It is constant int overridden with u suffix.
	10.		constant double
	10e-2	constant double. Scientific notation.
