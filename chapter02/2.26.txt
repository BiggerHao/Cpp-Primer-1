Exercise 2.26: Which of the following are legal? For those that are illegal,
explain why.
	(a) const int buf;			(b) int cnt = 0;
	(c) const int sz = cnt;		(d) ++cnt; ++sz;
By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) Illegal: constant variables must be initialized
(b)	legal: initialized at run time
(c) legal: int variable
(d) ++cnt is legal. It changes the contant of cnt but not that of the const int
	sz after it's been initialization. However, ++sz is illegal because it attempts
	to change (reassign) the value of a constant variable.
