Exercise 2.22: Assuming p is a pointer to int, explain the following code:

	if (p) // ...
	if (*p) // ...

By Faisal Saadatmand

if (p)   // if the value of p is not 0 (i.e. not nullptr), the condition is evaluated as true.
if (*p)  // if the value to which p points to is not 0, the condition is evaluated as true.
