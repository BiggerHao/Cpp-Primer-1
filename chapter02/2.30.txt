Exercise 2.30: For each of the following declarations indicate whether the object being
declared has top-level or low-level const.
	const int v2 = 0;		int v1 = v2;
	int *p1 = &v1, &r1 = v1;
	const int *p2 = &v2, *const p3 = &i, &r2 = v2;

const int v2 = 0;                              // top-level constant
int v1 = v2;                                   // nonconstant
int *p1 = &v1, &rq = v1;                       // nonconstant, rq low-level constant
const int *p2 = &v2, *const p3 = &i, &r2 = v2; // p2 low-level const, p3 both
													top-level and low-level
													constant, and r2 low-level
													constant.
