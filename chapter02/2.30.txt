Exercise 2.30: For each of the following declarations indicate whether the
object being declared has top-level or low-level const.

	const int v2 = 0;		int v1 = v2;
	int *p1 = &v1, &r1 = v1;
	const int *p2 = &v2, *const p3 = &i, &r2 = v2;

By Faisal Saadatmand

const int v2 = 0;
v2 has a top-level const.

int v1 = v2;
v1 has neither.

int *p1 = &v1, &rq = v1;
p1 has neither. As a reference, rq has an implicit top-level const.

const int *p2 = &v2, *const p3 = &i, &r2 = v2;
p2 has a low-level const, p3 and r2 have both top-level and low-level const.
