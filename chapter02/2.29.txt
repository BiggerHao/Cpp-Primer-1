Exercise 2.29: Uing the variables in the previous exercise, which of the
following assignments are legal? Explain why.
	(a) i = ic;		(b) p1 = p3;
	(c) p1 = &ic;	(d) p3 = &ic;
	(e) p2 = p1;	(f) ic = *p3;

variables:
	int i, *const cp;
	int *p1, *const p2;
	const int ic, &r = ic
	const int *const p3;
	const int *p;

(a) Legal: if ic were initialized; otherwise, illegal. Top-level const is ignored.
(b) illegal: even if p3 were initialize. Incompatible low-level const type.
(c) Illegal: p1 must be a pointer to a constant to hold the address of ic.
	Incompatible low-level const type.
(d) Legal: if p3 is initialized (not assigned/reassigned) as such. top-level
	constant is ignored.
(c) Legal: if p2 is initialized (not assigned/reassigned) as such. top-level
	const in p2 is ignored.
(d) Legal: if ic is initialized (not assigned/reassigned) as such. top-level
	consts are ignored.
