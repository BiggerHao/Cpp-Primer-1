Exercise 2.29: Uing the variables in the previous exercise, which of the
following assignments are legal? Explain why.
	(a) i = ic;		(b) p1 = p3;
	(c) p1 = &ic;	(d) p3 = &ic;
	(e) p2 = p1;	(f) ic = *p3;
By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) Legal if ic were initialized; otherwise, illegal.
(b) Legal if p3 were initialized; otherwise, illegal.
(c) Illegal: p1 must be a pointer to a constant to hold the value of ic.
(d) Illegal: p3 is a constant pointer. It cannot be assigned a value.It must be
	initialized instead.
(e) Illegal: p2 a constant pointer. It cannot be assigned a value. It must be
	initialized instead.
(d) Illegal: ic is a constant integer. It cannot be assigned a value, It must
	be initialized instead.
