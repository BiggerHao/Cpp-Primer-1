Exercise 2.36: In the following code, determine the type of each variable and
the value each variable has when the code finishes:

int a = 3, b = 4;
decltype(a) c = a;
decltype((b)) d = a;
++c;
++d;

By Faisal Saadatmand

c is an int, assigned the value of a
d is a reference to an int, bound to a

Value of each variable when the code finishes:
a     4
b     4
c     4
d is a reference to a
