Exercise 2.15: Which of the following definitions, if any, are invalid? Why?

	(a) int ival = 1.01;
	(b) int &rval1 = 1.01;
	(c) int &rval2 = ival;
	(d) int &rval3;

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) valid: ival is an int but value is truncated to 1.
(b) invalid: reference binds with objects only.
(c) valid; rval2 is a reference to ival and both are int.
(d) invalid; references must be initialized and cannot be rebound.
