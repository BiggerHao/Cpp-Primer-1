Exercise 2.28: Explain the following definitions. Identify any that are illegal.

	(a) int i, *const cp;		(b) int *p1, *const p2;
	(c) const int ic, &r = ic;	(d) const int *const p3;
	(e) const int *p;

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) i is an int object; cp is a constant pointer to an int. Illegal: cp is
	uninitialized.
(b) p1 is a pointer to an int; p2 is a constant pointer to an int. Illegal: p2
	is uninitialized.
(c) ic is an integer constant; r is a reference to an integer constant. Ilegal:
	ic is uninitialized.
(d) p3 is a constant pointer to an integer constant. Illegal: p3 is
	uninitialized.
(e) p is a pointer to an integer constant. Legal.
