Exercise 2.19: Explain the key differences between pointers and references.

reference:
- the use of & before an type declares a reference. E.g.: int &i = i;
- not an object in memory
- must be initialized
- its binding cannot be changed after initial definition

pointer:
- declared with * symbol. E.g.: int *p;
- assigned an address with an assign operator. E.g.: p = &a;
- assigned the value to which a pointer points to is dereferenced with *. E.g.: b = *p 
- is an object in memory
- can be declared but not initialized
- holds an address as a value
- its value can be change to point to another address
- can be used in pointer asthmatics
