Exercise 2.16: Which, if any, of the following assignments are invalid? If they
are valid, explain what they do.
	int i = 0, &r1 = i; double d = 0, &r2 = d;
	(a) r2 = 3.14159;
	(b) r2 = r1;
	(c) i = r2;
	(d) r1 = d;
By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) valid: 3.14159 is assigned to i.
(b) valid: value of i is assigned to d; value is converted to a double.
(c) valid: value of d is assigned to i; value is truncated to an int.
(d) valid; value of d is directly assigned to i; value is truncated to an int.
