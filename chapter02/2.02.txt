Exercise 2.1: What are the differences between int, long, long long, and short?
Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and a double?

By Faisal Saadatmand

An int, long, long long and short types are representation of integral types of
a chunk of allocated memory. The difference between them is in the size of the
representation (in bytes) of the respective type, which is often implementation
dependent.

The unsigned type represents a positive value, while an unsigned represents
both positive an negative values of an integral type (except for bool). The
limits range of the value depends on the size of integral type. Given that
unsigned holds only positive value, it has a higher max limit.

A float and a double are floating-point types that represent "single-, double-,
and extended-precision values." (p. 33) Their representation is implementation
dependent. Most compilers follow the IEEE 754 standard at least for float and
double.
