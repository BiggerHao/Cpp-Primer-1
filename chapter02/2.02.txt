Exercise 2.2: To calculate a mortgage payment, what types would you use for the
rate, principal, and payment? Explain why you selected each type.

By Faisal Saadatmand

When absolute accuracy is required, an integral type should be used instead of
a float. Such is the case with currency, in which one should use an integral
type for the lowest denominator of the currency (e.g.: cent for the Dollar
currency) rather than a float representing the value of the currency. 

That said, when calculating a mortgage payment we could use a double for the
rate, principle and the payment since the formula is fairly simple. As such it
won't produce much of discrepancy between the output and the expected result
that cannot be corrected by rounding up to two decimal points.
