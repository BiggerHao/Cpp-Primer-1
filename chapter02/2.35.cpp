/*
 * Exercise 2.35: Determine the types deduced in each of the following definitions. Once
 * youâ€™ve figured out the types, write a program to see whether you were correct.
 *
 *		const int i = 42;
 *		auto j = i; const auto &k = i; auto *p = &i;
 *		const auto j2 = i, &k2 = i;
 *
 * Answer:
 * auto j = il; const auto &k = i; auto *p = &i;
 * 		j is an int; top-level const is dropped.
 * 		k is a const reference to a const int bound to i.
 * 		p is a pointer constant to a const int;
 *
 * const auto j2 = i, &k2 = i;
 * 	j2 is a const int; top-level const deduced
 * 	k2 is a const reference to const int, bound to i
