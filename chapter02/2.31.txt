Exercise 2.31: Given the declarations in the previous exercise determine
whether the following assignments are legal. Explain how the top-level or
low-level const applies in each case.
	r1 = v2;
	p1 = p2;	p2 = p1;
	p1 = p3;	p2 = p3;
By Faisal Saadatmand

r1 = v2; // legal: copying top-level constant to a nonconstant reference to an
			int.
p1 = p2; // illegal: copying low-level constant (p2) to a nonconstant object
			(p1).
p2 = p1; // legal: nonconstant, but low-level const of p means the value of p1
			cannot be changed i through p2.
p1 = p3; // Illegal, is also low-level constant which cannot be assigned to a
			plain pointer to an int (nonconstant)
p2 = p3; // Legal: both p2 and p3 are low-level constants; top-level constant
			of p3 is ignored.
