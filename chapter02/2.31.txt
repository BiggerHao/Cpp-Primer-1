Exercise 2.31: Given the declarations in the previous exercise determine
whether the following assignments are legal. Explain how the top-level or
low-level const applies in each case.

	r1 = v2;
	p1 = p2;	p2 = p1;
	p1 = p3;	p2 = p3;

By Faisal Saadatmand

r1 = v2; // Illegal: r1 is a reference. It cannot be reassigned after
			initialization.
p1 = p2; // Illegal: copying low-level constant (p2) to a nonconst object (p1).
p2 = p1; // legal: but the low-level const of p2 means it cannot be used to
			change the value of p1.
p1 = p3; // Illegal: though the top-level const of p3 is ignored, its low-level
			const is not. Thus, it cannot be assigned to a pointer to a plain
			int.
p2 = p3; // Legal: both p2 and p3 have a low-level const; The top-level const
			of p3 is ignored.
