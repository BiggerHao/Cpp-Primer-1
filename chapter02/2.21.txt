Exercise 2.21: Explain each of the following definitions. Indicate whether any
are illegal and, if so, why.
	int i = 0;
	(a) double* dp = &i; (b) int *ip = i; (c) int *p = &i;
By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) Illegal: types must match. Declare dp as a pointer to a double and
	initialize it to the address of i, which is an int.
(b)	illegal: ip is a pointer to an int and can only hold an address as a value.
(a) declare dp as a pointer to a int and initialize it to the address of i
	(point to i).
