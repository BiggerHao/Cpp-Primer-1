Exercise 2.21: Explain each of the following definitions. Indicate whether any
are illegal and, if so, why.

	int i = 0;
	(a) double* dp = &i;	(b) int *ip = i;	(c) int *p = &i;

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) Illegal: types must match. Declare dp as a pointer to a double and
	initialize it to the address of i, which is an int.
(b)	Illegal: missing address operator. ip is a pointer to an int, and as such,
	it can only hold an address as a value.
(c) Legal: declare dp as a pointer to a int and initialize it to the address of i.
