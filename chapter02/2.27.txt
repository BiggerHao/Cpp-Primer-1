Exercise 2.27: Which of the following initializations are legal? Explain why.
	(a) int i = -1, &r = 0;			(b) int *const p2 = &i2;
	(c) const int i = -1, &r = 0; 	(d) const int *const p3 = &i2;
	(e) const int *p1 = &i2;		(f) const int &const r2;
	(g) const int i2 = i, &r = i;
By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) Illegal: r is a reference to an int but it is initialized with the constant 0.
(b) Legal: p2 is a constant pointer to an int, initialized with the address of i2.
(c) Legal:L r is a reference to a constant, initialized with the constant 0.
(d) Legal: p3 is a constant pointer to constant int, initialized with the address of i2.
(g) legal: r is a reference to a constant in, initialized with the constant in i.
