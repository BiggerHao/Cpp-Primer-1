Exercise 2.9: Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal,
explain whatâ€™s wrong and how to correct it.
	(a) std::cin >> int input_value;	(b) int i = { 3.14 };
	(c) double salary = wage = 9999.99;	(d) int i = 3.14;
By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) legal: define a variable int_value without initializing it.
(b) Illegal: list initialization of int with a value of type double will lead
	to data loss. Compiler will produce an error.
(c)	Illegal: wage is missing a type. Correction: double salary = 9999.99, wage
	= salary;
(d)	legal: define variable i and initialize it to 3.14. The value will be
	trancated to to 3.
