Exercise 16.67: Would defining these specializations affect function matching
for debug_rep? If so, how? If not, why not?

By Faisal Saadatmand

No. A specializations is an instantiations of a template, not an overloaded
definition. (p.708) It does not affect function matching. If the chosen
function base template (after the function matching is completed) provides a
specialization definition, that specialization would be use. See answer to
previous exercise for more details.
