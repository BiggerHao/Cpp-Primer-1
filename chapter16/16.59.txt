Exercise 16.59: Assuming s is a string, explain svec.emplace_back(s).

By Faisal Saadatmand

The call svec.emplace(s) will instantiate emplace as

	void emplace(string &&s);

s will be passed to emplace as an rvalue reference. Inside emplace, if there is
no allocated memory or not enough room for s, chk_n_alloc will reallocate svec
to create room. s then will be forwarded to alloc.construct, preserving it as
an rvalue reference. Then construct will create a string in the allocated
memory using the string move constructor.
