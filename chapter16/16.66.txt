Exercise 16.66: What are the advantages and disadvantages of overloading these
debug_rep functions as compared to defining specializations?

By Faisal Saadatmand

Specializations are instantiations of a template, and do not overload it. As a
consequence, they do not not participate in function matching. (p. 708) This
means that using specializations could potentially lead to surprising effect,
in which an overload is called instead of the intended specializations.  This
is so because a specialization instant is considered by the compiler only
if the base function is viable and is the best match--which is to say, after
the overload resolution had taken place--otherwise it is ignored.

By contrast, overloaded functions are more predictable and easier to write,
especially nontemplate overloaded functions. Nontemplate functions are
first-class citizens in function matching, i.e. they are preferred over all
other overloads in the case of an equally good match.

Here is an excellent piece by Hurb Sutter that explains overload resolution
rules and specializations: http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill17.htm
