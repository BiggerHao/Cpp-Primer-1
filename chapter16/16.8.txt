Exercise 16.8: In the “Key Concept” box on page 108, we noted that as a matter
of habit C++ programmers prefer using != to using <. Explain the rationale for
this habit.

The library containers use function templates to define their begin and end
member functions. Given the generic nature of function templates, the
containers share the same code for such operation. However, the ability to
share a common template code deepened on the class' implementation of certain
overloaded operators. Since more classes define != rather than < would mean
fewer function templates definitions are needed to support the begin and end
operations.
