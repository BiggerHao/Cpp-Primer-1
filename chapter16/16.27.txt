Exercise 16.27: For each labeled statement explain what, if any, instantiations
happen. If a template is instantiated, explain why; if not, explain why not.

	template <typename T> class Stack { };
	void f1(Stack<char>); // (a)
	class Exercise {
		Stack<double> &rsd; // (b)
		Stack<int> si; // (c)
	};
	int main() {
		Stack<char> *sc; // (d)
		f1(*sc); // (e)
		int iObj = sizeof(Stack< string >); // (f)
	}

(a) No instantiation: this is a function declaration; Stack<char> is not used yet.
(b) Instantiation: Stack<double> is instantiated because it is used in class
	definition. However, this code is erroneous because there is no
	constructor to initialize &rsd.
(c) Instantiation: Stack<int> used. si is default initialized.
(d) No instantiation: this a declaration, Stack<char> is not used.
(e) Instantiation: Stack<char> is used by a callable object (function)
(f) Instantiation: Sack<string> is used. Default constructor is called.
