Exercise 16.31: Explain how the compiler might inline the call to the deleter
if we used DebugDelete with unique_ptr.

By Faisal Saadatmand

The type of the deleter is part of the type of the object; as such, it must be
known at compile time and not change throughout the lifetime of the object.
Given this, compiler could inline the call to DebugDelete to avoid the overhead
of calling the function at runtime.
