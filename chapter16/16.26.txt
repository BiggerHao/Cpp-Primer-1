Exercise 16.26: Assuming NoDefault is a class that does not have a default
constructor, can we explicitly instantiate vector<NoDefault>? If not, why not?

By Faisal Saadatmand

No, because in order to instantiate a class (a vector in this case) the class
(or type) used for its parameter type must be default constructable.
