Exercise 16.38: When we call make_shared (ยง 12.1.1, p. 451), we have to provide
an explicit template argument. Explain why that argument is needed and how it
is used.

By Faisal Saadatmand

make_shared function return type (shared_ptr) differs from its parameter type
(overloaded). Therefore, its return type cannot be deduced from the template
argument. Therefore, we must provide an explicit template argument for its
return type.
