Exercise 16.37: The library max function has two function parameters and
returns the larger of its arguments. This function has one template type
parameter. Could you call max passing it an int and a double? If so, how? If
not, why not?

By Faisal Saadatmand

Yes, we can use an explicit template arguments, and normal conversion will take
place (p. 682-683). Use the following syntax:

	auto bigger = std::max<int>(5, 7.5);
or 
	auto bigger = std::max<double>(5, 7.5);
