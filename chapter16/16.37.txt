Exercise 16.37: The library max function has two function parameters and
returns the larger of its arguments. This function has one template type
parameter. Could you call max passing it an int and a double? If so, how? If
not, why not?

By Faisal Saadatmand

No, because it has one template type parameter, which means the type of the two
parameters is the same, and therefore, to be deduced from the call arguments,
the type of the arguments must match. Normal conversion are not performed.
