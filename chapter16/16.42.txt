Exercise 16.42: Determine the type of T and of val in each of the following calls:

	template <typename T> void g(T&& val);
	int i = 0; const int ci = i;
	(a) g(i); (b) g(ci); (c) g(i * ci);

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) T is int &; val is int &
	T&& val is int&& & and collapses into int &

(b) T is const int &; val is const int &
	T&& val is const int && & and collapses into const int &

(c) T is int &&; val is an rvalue (top-level const is dropped after the
	evaluation of i * ci)
