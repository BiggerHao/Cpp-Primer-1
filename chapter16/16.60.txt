Exercise 16.60: Explain how make_shared (ยง 12.1.1, p. 451) works.

By Faisal Saadatmand


make_shared is a variadic template function. It is a nonmember function of
shared_ptr class. Assuming that it has the following declaration:

template <typename T, typename... Args)
shared_ptr<T> make_shared(Args&&... args);

It takes a function parameter pack of varying types and returns a shared_ptr
pointing to a dynamically allocated object of type T.

Inside its body, make_shared expands the function parameter pack and forwards
them (as arguments) to the 'new' expression to allocate a block of memory of
type T.  The pointer returned from new is passed to shared_ptr constructor that
takes a built-in pointer (T*) and an optional callable object. The newly
constructed shared_ptr is returned by value.

Given that make_shared's return type differs from its parameter types, an
explicit template argument of type T (for the return type) is used when calling
make_shared.
