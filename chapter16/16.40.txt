Exercise 16.40: Is the following function legal? If not, why not? If it is
legal, what, if any, are the restrictions on the argument type(s) that can be
passed, and what is the return type?

	template <typename It>
	auto fcn3(It beg, It end) -> decltype(*beg + 0)
	{
		// process the range
		return *beg; // return a copy of an element from the range
	}

By Faisal Saadatmand

The function is legal. However, the arguments that can be passed must be of
arithmetic types. That is so because of the *beg + 0 expression. In this case,
dereferencing beg must yield a reference to a type that is promotable to an int
or that the int 0 is convertible to, otherwise the expression would be illegal.
Accordingly, The return value of fcn would reflect the result of the arithmetic
conversion between the type of the arguments passed and an int.
