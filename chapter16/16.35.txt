Exercise 16.35: Which, if any, of the following calls are errors? If the call
is legal, what is the type of T? If the call is not legal, what is the problem?

	template <typename T> T calc(T, int);
	template <typename T> T fcn(T, T);
	double d; float f; char c;
	(a) calc(c, 'c');
	(b) calc(d, f);
	(c) fcn(c, 'c');
	(d) fcn(d, f);

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) Legal: T is char
(b) Legal: T is double
(c) Legal: c is a char and 'c' is a character literal, which the compiler
	interprets as char. T is char (p. 679)
(d) Illegal: d is a double and f is a float, automatic arithmetic conversions
	do not take place in template argument deduction.
