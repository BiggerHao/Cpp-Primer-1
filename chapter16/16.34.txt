Exercise 16.34: Given only the following code, explain whether each of these
calls is legal. If so, what is the type of T? If not, why not?

	template <class T> int compare(const T&, const T&);
	(a) compare("hi", "world");
	(b) compare("bye", "dad");

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) Illegal: both arguments are of type const char*, which are essentially
	arrays of characters: const char []. Given that the function parameters use
	the same template parameter type, means that both argument must have the
	same type.  (p. 680) The size of "hi" is smaller than "world", and
	thereafter, their types do not match (remember, the size of an array is
	part of its type).

(b) Legal, both arguments have the same type (and size). See (a) for the
	explanation.
