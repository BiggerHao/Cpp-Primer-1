Exercise 5.18: Explain each of the following loops. Correct any problems you
detect.
	(a) do
			int v1, v2;
			cout << "Please enter two numbers to sum:" ;
			if (cin >> v1 >> v2)
			cout << "Sum is: " << v1 + v2 << endl;
		while (cin);
	(b) do {
			// . . .
		} while (int ival = get_response());
	(c) do {
			int ival = get_response();
		} while (ival);

(a) Prints the sum of two integers as long as the user has entered two integers.
	issue: missing curly braces
	correction:

	do {
		int v1, v2;
		cout << "Please enter two numbers to sum: ";
		if (cin >> v1 >> v2)
		cout << "Sum is: " << v1 + v2 << endl;
	} while (cin);

(b) loops while ival evaluates true.
	issue: ival declared in scope of the while condition; expression is missing
			parentheses.
	correction:
	int ival;
	do {
		// ...
	} while ((ival = get_response()))

(c) same as the above
	issue: ival declared in scope of the do loop's body.
	correction:
	int ival;
	do {
		ival = get_response();
	} while (ival);
