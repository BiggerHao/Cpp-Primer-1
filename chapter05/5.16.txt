Exercise 5.16: The while loop is particularly good at executing while some
condition holds; for example, when we need to read values until end-of-file.
The for loop is generally thought of as a step loop: An index steps through a
range of values in a collection. Write an idiomatic use of each loop and then
rewrite each using the other loop construct. If you could use only one loop,
which would you choose? Why?

I'd choose the foor loop. I think in most cases its clearer and more compact. 

	// while: while some condition holds
	std::string str;
	while (std::cin >> str) {
		cout << str << " ";    // echo str
	}
	std::cout << '\n';

	// for loop: index step
	std::string line;
	for (decltype(line.size()) i = 0; i != line.size() - 1; ++i)
		line[i] = toupper(lin[i]);  // capitalized the first letter of each line

	
	// while loop: index step
	std::string line;
	decltype(line.size() i = 0;
	while (i != line.szie() - 1) {
		line[i] = toupper(lin[i]);  // capitalized the first letter of each line
		++i;
	}
		
	// for loop: while some condition holds
	for (std::string str; std:cin >> str; ) 
		std::cout << str << " ";    // echo str
	std::cout << '\n';
