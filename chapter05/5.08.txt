Exercise 5.8: What is a “dangling else”? How are else clauses resolved in C++?

By Faisal Saadatmand

A dangling else occurs when there are more if clauses than else clauses in a
nested if-else statement. The matching of the remaining else, i.e. dangling,
with an if statement is ambiguous. C++ resolves this by matching each else
clause with the closest preceding unmatched if clause. The use of explicit
curly braces to delimits the scopes of the inner and outer if-else statements
removes this ambiguity.
