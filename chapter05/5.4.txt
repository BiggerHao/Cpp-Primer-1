Exercise 5.4: Explain each of the following examples, and correct any problems
you detect.

	(a) while (string::iterator iter != s.end()) { /* . . . */ }
	(b) while (bool status = find(word)) { /* . . . */ }

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) iter is declared in the scope of the while statement at every iteration of
the loop. Moreover, it used in loop's condition uninitialized. This an error.
Also, a potential problem, is that the statement will loop forever, unless iter
is changed within the body of the loop. Correction:
	string:iterator iter = s.begin();
	while (iter != s.ed() { /* . . . */}

(b) the while loops as long as the result of the assignment returns true, which
	depends on the returned value of find() function.
