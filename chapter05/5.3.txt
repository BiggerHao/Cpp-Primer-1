Exercise 5.3: Use the comma operator (ยง 4.10, p. 157) to rewrite the while loop
from ยง 1.4.1 (p. 11) so that it no longer requires a block. Explain whether
this rewrite improves or diminishes the readability of this code.

By Faisal Saadatmand

	int sum = 0, val = 1;

	while (sum += val, val++ <= 10)
		;

	std::cout << "Sum of 1 to 10 inclusive is "
		<< sum << std::endl;
	
This diminishes the readability of the code considerably. Given that the comma
operator evaluates expressions from left to right and that the right-hand side
operand is discard while the left hand side operand is returned, not mention
the postfix increment, it difficult to discern the loop's condition from its
the body.
