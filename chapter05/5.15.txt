Exercise 5.15: Explain each of the following loops. Correct any problems you
detect.

	(a) for (int ix = 0; ix != sz; ++ix) { /* . . . */ }
		if (ix != sz)
				// . . .
	(b) int ix;
		for (ix != sz; ++ix) { /* . . . */ }
	(c) for (int ix = 0; ix != sz; ++ix, ++ sz) { /* . . . */ }

(a) The loop presumably iterates through elements of a string, a vector or an
	array. It stops when the last element is reached. The if statements after the
	loop checks if the container object has been read completely.
	Issues: sz is uninitialized.
	Correction:
		for (decltype(v.size()) ix = 0, sz = v.end(); ix != sz; ++ix) { /* ... */ } 

(b) Does the same thing as a.
	Issues: missing initializing statement and both ix and sz
	uninitialized.
	Correction:
		for (decltype(v.size()) ix = 0, sz = v.end(); ix != sz; ++ix) { /* ... */ } 
	
(c) Does the same thing as a.
	Issues: The condition will always be false; therefore, if
	started, the loop will never terminate. This is so because sz is incremented at
	the same rate as ix.  Again, sz is uninitialized.
	Correction:
		for (decltype(v.size()) ix = 0, sz = v.end(); ix != sz; ++ix) { /* ... */ }
