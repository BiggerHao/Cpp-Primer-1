Exercise 5.2: What is a block? When might you might use a block?

By Faisal Saadatmand

A block is a compound statement. That is, "a sequence of statements and
declarations surrounded by a pair of curly braces." (p. 173) Moreover, a block
is a scope. We can use it when our logic requires more than a single statement.
Thus it allows us to group together a set of statements for sequential
executions to achieve a logical task. A block can be used to define loops, if
statements, functions, etc.
