Exercise 5.1: What is a null statement? When might you use a null statement?

By Faisal Saadatmand

A null statement is an empty statement that is terminated by a semicolon. "A
null statement is useful where the language requires a statement but the pro-
gramâ€™s logic does not" (p. 172), for example, when the task of a loop can be
done in its condition statement.

	std::string s("/* hello!! */");
	char c;

	// find the first alphanumeric character in s
	for (auto it = s.begin(); (c = *it) && !isalnum(c); ++it)
		;
	
	std::cout << c << '\n';
