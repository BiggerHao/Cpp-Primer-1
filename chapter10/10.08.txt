Exercise 10.8: We said that algorithms do not change the size of the containers
over which they operate. Why doesn't the use of back_inserter invalidate this
claim?

Because an assignment through an back_inserter iterator calls the push_back
operation.  (p.382) That is, the insertion (or resizing) is handled by the
container's operation and not the algorithm.
