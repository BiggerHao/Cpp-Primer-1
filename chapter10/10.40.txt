Exercise 10.40: What kinds of iterators do you think copy requires?  What about
reverse or unique?

By Faisal Saadatmand

The copy function requires a minimum input iterators for its first two arguments
and an output for its third (the destination iterator).

The reverse function requires a minimum a bidirectional iterators, because the
algorithm requires read, write, and multi-pass access, and bidirectional
movement through the container.

The unique function requires a minimum forward iterators, because the algorithm
requires read, write and multi-pass access, but not bidirectional movement through
the container.
