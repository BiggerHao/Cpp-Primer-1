Exercise 10.23: How many arguments does bind take?

by Faisal Saadatmand

bing is a variadic function, i.e. the number of its arguments varies. It
depends on the callable it is processing. Although, we could say that bind
takes the same number of arguments of the callable's plus 1 (the callable
itself).
