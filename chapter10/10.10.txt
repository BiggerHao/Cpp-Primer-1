Exercise 10.10: Why do you think the algorithms donâ€™t change the size of
containers?

Because algorithms operate on a FIXED range of iterators. Changing the size of
a container would invalidate the iterators, in which case the algorithm would
have to refresh the iterators. This duplicates work and makes the algorithm
functions do more than what their name suggests or should. It is a better
design to leave the container related tasks (such as resizing) to the
container's operations.
