Exercise 14.3: Both string and vector define an overloaded == that can be used
to compare objects of those types. Assuming svec1 and svec2 are vectors that
hold strings, identify which version of == is applied in each of the following
expressions:

	(a) "cobble" == "stone"
	(b) svec1[0] == svec2[0]
	(c) svec1 == svec2
	(d) "svec1[0] == "stone"

(a) neither versions: use std::strcmp for string literal comparison 
(b) string version
(c) vector version
(d) string version, assuming that the first quotation mark is a type
