Exercise 14.50: Show the possible class-type conversion sequences for the
initializations of ex1 and ex2. Explain whether the initializations are legal
or not.

	struct LongDouble {
		LongDouble(double = 0.0);
		operator double();
		operator float();
	};
	LongDouble ldObj;
	int ex1 = ldObj;
	float ex2 = ldObj;

By Faisal Saadatmand


	int ex1 = ldObj;

Illegal: The conversion of ldObj to int is ambiguous because it has two equally
viable paths: standard conversion int to double, then use operator double() or
standard conversion int to float, then use operator float().

	float ex2 = ldObj;

Legal: converts ldObj to float using operator float();
