Exercise 14.11: What, if anything, is wrong with the following Sales_data input
operator? What would happen if we gave this operator the data in the previous
exercise?

	istream& operator>>(istream& in, Sales_data& s)
	{
		double price;
		in >> s.bookNo >> s.units_sold >> price;
		s.revenue = s.units_sold * price;
		return in;
	}

By Faisal Saadatmand

The input operator does not check for input errors. If given to the data from
the previous exercise, the input stream will fail with (b), and, as a result,
the Sales_data object s will be in an invalid state.
