Exercise 14.51: Show the conversion sequences (if any) needed to call each
version of calc and explain why the best viable function is selected.

	void calc(int);
	void calc(LongDouble);
	double dval;
	calc(dval); // which calc?

By Faisal Saadatmand

void call(int) is the best viable function because it requires a standard
conversion of double to int, which produces an exact function match. void
call(LongDouble) requires a class-conversion which holds a lower rank than
standard conversion. See section 6.6.1 (p. 245) for conversion ranking.
