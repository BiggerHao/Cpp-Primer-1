Exercise 14.1: In what ways does an overloaded operator differ from a built-in
operator? In what ways are overloaded operators the same as the built-in
operators?

By Faisal Saadatmand

An overloaded operator is a user-defined operator that changes the "meaning of
an operator when applied to operands(s) of a class type". (p. 552) As such, it
is a class function, either a member or nonmember, that are meant to perform
analogous operations on its operands as the built-in operators. Though, the
overloaded version has the same precedence and associativity as the
corresponding built-in one (p. 553), because, it is a function, it does not
guarantee the order in which operands are evaluated. Therefore, "the comma,
address-of, logical AND, and logical OR operators should not be overloaded."
(p. 554)
