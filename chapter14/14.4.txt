Exercise 14.4: Explain how to decide whether the following should be class members:

	(a) %	(b) %=	(c) ++	(d) ->	(e) <<	(f) &&	(g) ==	(h) ()

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) % is a symmetric operator (arithmetic). It should be nonmember function.
(b) %= is compound operator. It ought to be a member function, though is not
	required to be so.
(c) ++ is an operator that changes its object. It should be a member function.
(d) -> is an operator that changed the state of its object. It should be a
	member function.
(e) << is a symmetric operator (input or bitwise). It should be a nonmember
	function.
(f) The logical && should not be overload. (p. 553-554)
(g) == is a symmetric operator (equality). It should be a nonmember function.
(h) The call operator () must be a member function.
