Exercise 14.47: Explain the difference between these two conversion operators:

	struct Integral {
		operator const int();
		operator int() const;
	};

By Faisal Saadatmand

operator const int()  // implicitly convert Integral to int;
                      // high-level const is ignored
operator int() const; // implicitly convert Integral to int
