Exercise 14.53: Given the definition of SmallInt on page 588, determine whether
the following addition expression is legal. If so, what addition operator is
used? If not, how might you change the code to make it legal?

	SmallInt s1;
	double d = s1 + 3.14;

By Faisal Saadatmand

The call is illegal because it is ambiguous. Thw two possibilities are

a) convert s1 to int to use the built-in operator+(int, double)
b) convert 3.14 to int and then to SmallInt (class conversion) to us
   SmallInt operator+(const SmallInt&, const SmallInt&)

We can resolve the ambiguity by not providing both a conversion function to an
arithmetic type and an overloaded operator+ for the same class type (p. 589).
For example,

class SmallInt {
	// remove overloaded operator+	
	public:
		SmallInt(int = 0) : val(i) {}
		operator int() const { return val; }
	private:
		std::size_t val;
};
