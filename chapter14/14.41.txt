Exercise 14.41: Why do you suppose the new standard added lambdas?  Explain
when you would use a lambda and when you would write a class instead.

By Faisal Saadatmand

lambdas provide an easier and more concise way to create "disposable" functions
on the fly to perform certain tasks, usually one line procedure. They are
especially useful when combined with algorithms that take predicates or
functions that take pointers to a function or return a function.  However, if
the task requires procedures that are longer than one line, it is better to use
a function-object or a function with std::bind.
