Exercise 14.24: Decide whether the class you used in exercise 7.40 from ยง 7.5.1
(p. 291) needs a copy- and move-assignment operator. If so, define those
operators.

By Faisal Saadatmand

The class does not allocate resources on the heap and the construction its
object do not require special operations; therefore, the synthesized copy- and
move-assignment operators would suffice.
