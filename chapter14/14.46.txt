Exercise 14.46: Explain whether defining these Sales_data conversion operators
is a good idea and whether they should be explicit.

By Faisal Saadatmand

It is not a good idea, because there is not a single one-to-one mapping between
Sales_data and the conversions to string or double. For the string type, one
could expect the return value to be either a book's isbn or the entire set of
data associated with the book (as the name of the class suggests). Should the
user require such a conversion, using an explicit conversion operator instead
could eliminate the ambiguity. As for the conversion to double, if it would
even make sense at all, could lead to surprising results, for it is not clear
what value would be returned by the conversion. Thus, it is best not to define
one.
