Exercise 14.48: Determine whether the class you used in exercise 7.40 from ยง
7.5.1 (p. 291) should have a conversion to bool. If so, explain why, and
explain whether the operator should be explicit. If not, explain why not.

By Faisal Saadatmand

No. The only useful case for such a conversion (which would be explicit) is
when we intend to use it in a condition. However, the same can be achieved
without any surprising results by defining an ordinary member operator that
returns a bool for given test, for example, bool nodata() const.
