Exercise 4.15: The following assignment is illegal. Why? How would you correct
it?

	double dval; int ival; int *pi;
	dval = ival = pi = 0;

By Faisal Saadatmand

Yes, because it assigns a pointer value to an int. Correction:

	double dval; int ival; int *pi;
	dval = ival = 0;          // Note the implicit conversion.
	pi = nullptr;
