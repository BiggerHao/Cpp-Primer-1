Exercise 4.15: The following assignment is illegal. Why? How would you correct
it?

	double dval; int ival; int *pi;
	dval = ival = pi = 0;

By Faisal Saadatmand

Because the variables' types do not match or are not implicitly convertible to
one another. In particular, ival = p = 0  tries to assign a pointer value
(address 0) to an int.

Correction:
	double dval; int ival; int *pi;
	dval = ival = 0; // Note the implicit conversion.
	pi = nullptr;
