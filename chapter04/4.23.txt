Exercise 4.23: The following expression fails to compile due to operator
precedence. Using Table 4.12 (p. 166), explain why it fails. How would you fix
it?

	string s = "word";
	string pl = s + s[s.size() - 1] == 's' ? "" : "s";

By Faisal Saadatmand

LHE: s + s[s.size() - 1] 
RHE: 's' ? "" : "s";
operator: ==

The conditional ?: operator has a lower precedence than the equality ==
operator. Since that == is left associative it will group with 's'. The result
would be comparing the LHE with 's'. Correction:

	string pl = s + s[s.size() - 1] == ('s' ? "" : "s");
