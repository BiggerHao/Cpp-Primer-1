Exercise 4.20: Assuming that iter is a vector<string>::iterator, indicate
which, if any, of the following expressions are legal. Explain the behavior of
the legal expressions and why those that arenâ€™t legal are in error.

	(a) *iter++;        (b) (*iter)++;        (c) *iter.empty()   
	(d) iter->empty();  (e) ++*iter;          (f) iter++->empty();

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) Legal: dereference iter (copy); increment iter. Yields lvalue.
(b) Legal:  dereference iter; increment its value (what it points to). Yields
	rvalue.
(c) Ilegal: dereference operator has a lower precedence than dot operator.
(d) legal: return true if iter points to an empty string. Implicit dereferencing
	of iter in arrow operator.
(e) Illegal: attempting to increment a vector of strings.
(f) Legal: same as d but with postfix increment of iter.
