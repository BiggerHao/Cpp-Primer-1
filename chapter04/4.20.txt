Exercise 4.20: Assuming that iter is a vector<string>::iterator, indicate
which, if any, of the following expressions are legal. Explain the behavior of
the legal expressions and why those that arenâ€™t legal are in error.

	(a) *iter++;        (b) (*iter)++;        (c) *iter.empty()   
	(d) iter->empty();  (e) ++*iter;          (f) iter++->empty();

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) Legal: posfix increment iter, dereference (a copy of) iter.
(b) Ilegal: attempting to increment a string.
(c) Ilegal: * operator has a lower precedence than . and () operators.
(d) legal: dereference iter and then evaluate . and () operators.
(e) Illegal: the same as b.
(f) Legal: the same as d but with postfix increment of iter.
