Exercise 4.33: Using Table 4.12 (p. 166) explain what the following expression
does:

	someValue ? ++x, ++y : --x, --y

By Faisal Saadatmand

The intention of the conditional statement operator seems to be to evaluate the
variable someValue. If the result is true (i.e.: not 0), x and y are
incremented, otherwise x and y are decremented. The issue, however, is that the
comma operator has a lower precedence than the conditional statement operator,
and given that the ?: is right associative, the statement would have the
following effect (order of evaluation is undefined):

	someValue ? ++x : --x;
	++y, --y;

As opposed to:

	someValue ? (++x, ++y) ; --x, --y);
