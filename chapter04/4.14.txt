Exercise 4.14: Explain what happens in each of the if tests:

	if (42 = i) // ...
	if (i = 42) // ...

By Faisal Saadatmand

if (42 = i)  // ERROR: 42 is an rvalue, which is not assignable. The code
				will not compile.
if (i = 42)  // BUG: i is assigned the value of 42. The result of the
				statement is always true. Most certainly the intention
				was i == 42.

Note:
writing the condition expression as

	if (42 == i) // ...

is a trick to guard against the aforementioned bug: if the condition were
mistakenly written as 42 = i, the code will not compile. This strategy,
however, will not work when comparing two lvalues, e.g.: a = b or b = a will
compile fine as a condition statement.
