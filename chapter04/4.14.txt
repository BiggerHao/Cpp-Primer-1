Exercise 4.14: Explain what happens in each of the if tests:

	if (42 = i) // ...
	if (i = 42) // ...

By Faisal Saadatmand

if (42 = i)  // ERROR: 42 is an rvalue which is not assignable.
if (i = 42)  // BUG: i is assigned the value of 42. The result of the statement is
				always true. Most certainly the intention was if (i == 42)

if (42 == i) // a trick to guard against the aforementioned bug. It will not,
				however, protect you when comparing two lvalues, e.g.: if (a = b) // ...
