Exercise 4.26: In our grading example in this section, what would happen if we
used unsigned int as the type for quiz1?

By Faisal Saadatmand

Using an unsigned int instead of an unsigned long could potentially invoke
undefined behaviour because the size of an int is implementation dependent. The
C++ standard specifies a 'minimum' size for an int, which is 2 bytes. This
means that on a 16-bit machine an int is guaranteed to be 2 bytes, while on a
32-bit machine it could be either 2 or 4 bytes. The grading example needs at
least 4 bytes to represent the data set of 30 students (one bit per student).
Anything less would overflow the range of values an int could hold.
