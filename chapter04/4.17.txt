Exercise 4.17: Explain the difference between prefix and postfix increment.

By Faisal Saadatmand

The prefix increment adds 1 to the operand and then yields the change as a
result, while the postfix yields its operand and then adds 1 to it. In other
words, the former returns a changed value as a result, while the latter returns
a copy of the original, "unchanged value as a result".  (p.148) Both require an
lvalue operands. The prefix returns an lvalue and the postfix an rvalue. The
prefix and postfix decrement operators work the same way.
