Exercise 4.17: Explain the difference between prefix and postfix increment.

By Faisal Saadatmand

The prefix increment (or decrement) increments the operand first and then
evaluates its, while postfix increment (or decrement) evaluates its operand
first and then increments it. The former returns a changed value as a result
(lvalue) , while the latter returns a copy of the original, "unchanged value as
a result" (rvalue).  (p.148) Both require an lvalue.
