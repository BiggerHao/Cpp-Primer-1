Exercise 4.17: Explain the difference between prefix and postfix increment.

By Faisal Saadatmand

The prefix increment increments the operand first and then evaluates it, while
postfix increment evaluates its operand first and then increments it. The
former returns a changed value as a result, while the latter returns a copy of
the original, "unchanged value as a result".  (p.148) Both require an lvalue
and return an lvalue. The prefix and postfix decrement works the same way.
