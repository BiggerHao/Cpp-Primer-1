Exercise 4.8: Explain when operands are evaluated in the logical AND, logical
OR, and equality operators.

By Faisal Saadatmand

With Logical AND and logical OR operators the operands are evaluated from left
to right. Moreover, the right operand is evaluated only if the result cannot be
determined by the left operand. This is known as short-circuit evaluation.

Equality operators the operands also are evaluated from left to right; however,
both operands must be evaluated in order to determine the result.
