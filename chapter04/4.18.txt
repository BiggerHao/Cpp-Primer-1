Exercise 4.18: What would happen if the while loop on page 148 that prints
the elements from a vector used the prefix increment operator?

By Faisal Saadatmand

We would have an undefined behaviour, because the order of operands evaluation
is undefined in C++. This is especially problematic when an increment (or
decrement) operator changes either the left-hand or the right-hand
operand--of the same lvalue--of an operator (such as an assignment) in
expression.
