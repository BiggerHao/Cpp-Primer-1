Exercise 4.34: Given the variable definitions in this section, explain what
conversions take place in the following expressions:

	(a) if (fval)
	(b) dval = fval + ival;
	(c) dval + ival * cval;

Remember that you may need to consider the associativity of the operators.

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) fval is converted to bool. if fval is 0 then the result is false, otherwise
	true.
(b) ival is converted to a float and added to fval. The result is converted to a
	double. The initializer's type dominates.
(c) cval is converted to int and multiplied by ival (operator associativity).
	Then the product is converted to a double and added to dval.
