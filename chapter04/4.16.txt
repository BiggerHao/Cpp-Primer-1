Exercise 4.16: Although the following are legal, they probably do not behave as
the programmer expects. Why? Rewrite the expressions as you think they should
be.

	(a) if (p = getPtr() != 0)
	(b) if (i = 1024)

(a) The assignment operator has a lower precedence than the relational NOT
	Equal operator. P will be assigned the result of the expression
	(getPtr() != 0), which is a boolean value.

	Correction:
		if ((p = getPtr()) != 0)

(b) The = is an assignment operator, which means that the if statement
	expression will always be true. Most likely, the intention was to test for
	equality.

	Correction:
		if (i == 1024)
