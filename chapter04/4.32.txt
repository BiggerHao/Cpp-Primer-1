Exercise 4.32: Explain the following loop.

	constexpr int size = 5;
	int ia[size] = {1,2,3,4,5};
	for (int *ptr = ia, ix = 0;
		ix != size && ptr != ia + size; ++ix, ++ptr)
	{ /* . . . */ }

By Faisal Saadatmand

The loop iterates through the elements of array ia. The variable ptr is a
pointer to ia and ix is subscript to index ia. Both are initialized in the for
loop's initial statement using a comma seperaor. The loop's condition performs
2 tests using logical AND, which imply short-ciruit evaluation. The subscript
ix must not equal the size of ia AND ptr must not point to one past the last
element in ia. If either test fails the loop terminates. On each iteration
(with the exception of the first) ix and ptr are incremented with the prefix
incremet operator. Once more the comma operator is used.
