Exercise 4.3: Order of evaluation for most of the binary operators is left
undefined to give the compiler opportunities for optimization. This strategy
presents a trade-off between efficient code generation and potential pitfalls
in the use of the language by the programmer. Do you consider that an
acceptable trade-off? Why or why not?

By Faisal Saadatmand

I think this is a reasonable trade-off, given that a key aspect of the C++
language is performance. Though it would introduce potential pitfalls in the
use of the language by the programmer, one could always follow a good rule of
thumb when employing binary operators: never to relay on their order of
evaluation, unless they are specified.
