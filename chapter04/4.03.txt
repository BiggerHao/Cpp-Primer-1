Exercise 4.3: Order of evaluation for most of the binary operators is left
undefined to give the compiler opportunities for optimization. This strategy
presents a trade-off between efficient code generation and potential pitfalls
in the use of the language by the programmer. Do you consider that an
acceptable trade-off? Why or why not?

By Faisal Saadatmand

I think this is a reasonable trade-off, especially since 'assigning' an order
of evaluation to all the binary operators could introduce more complexity to
the language and potentially even more pitfalls than it would fix. A good rule
of thump to follow is never to relay on the order of evaluation of a binary
operator, unless it is specified.
