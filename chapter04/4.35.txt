Exercise 4.35: Given the following definitions,

	char cval;
	int ival;
	unsigned int ui;
	float fval;
	double dval;

identify the implicit type conversions, if any, taking place:

	(a) cval = 'a' + 3;
	(b) fval = ui - ival * 1.0;
	(c) dval = ui * fval;
	(d) cval = ival + fval + dval;

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) a is converted to int, add to 3 and the result is converted to char (truncated).
(b) iva is converted to a double. To evaluate the result of the subtraction
	the conversion is implementation dependent, i.e.: depends on the size of
	unsigned and double. The result of the assignment operator is a conversion to a
	float.
(c) Conversion depends on the size of unsigned int and float. Result of
	 the assignment is a conversion to a double.
(d) ival is converted to float, added to fval. The result of the addition is
	converted to a double and added to dval. The final result is converted to int
	and then char, truncated at each conversion, with the assignment operator.
