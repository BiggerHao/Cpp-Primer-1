Exercise 4.2: Using Table 4.12 (p. 166), parenthesize the following expressions
to indicate the order in which the operands are grouped:

	(a) * vec.begin()
	(b) * vec.begin() + 1

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) * (vec.begin())
	Rules of evaluation
		precedence: . () are equal, and * is lower than both
		Order of associativity (left to right): . () 
(b) (* (vec.begin()) + 1)
	Rules of evaluation:
		precedence: . () are equal and * + are equal but lower than . ()
		Order of associativity (left to right): . () 
		Order of associativity (right to left): * +
