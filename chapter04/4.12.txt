Exercise 4.12: Assuming i, j, and k are all ints, explain what i != j < k
means.

By Faisal Saadatmand 

The first part of the expression, i != j, evaluates true if the value of i does
NOT equal to the value of j. The second part, < k, evaluated if the value of k
is less than the result of the first expression, i != j, which is a boolean
value. The boolean value will be converted to int.
