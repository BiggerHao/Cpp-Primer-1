Exercise 4.12: Assuming i, j, and k are all ints, explain what i != j < k
means.

By Faisal Saadatmand 

The operator < has a higher precedence than !=. Accordingly, j < k is evaluated
first, which would result in either 0 or 1 (true or false). Thus, the entire
expression i != j < k means that i must not equal the result of j < k. In other
words, the result of expressions on either side of the operator != must not
equal each other.
