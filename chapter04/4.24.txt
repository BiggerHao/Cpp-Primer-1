Exercise 4.24: Our program that distinguished between high pass, pass, and fail
depended on the fact that the conditional operator is right associative.
Describe how that operator would be evaluated if the operator were left
associative.

By Faisal Saadatmand

If expression (grade > 90) evaluates the return value is "high pass", and if
false the return value is the result of the expression (grade < 60). This will
give us a compile error, because the conditional operator could potential
return a boolean (rvalue) to be assigned to a character point or string. The
following is a parenthesised version of the expression to override the default
precedence to simulate right associative behaviour: 

	finalgrade = ((grade > 90) ? "high pass" : (grade < 60))
				 (? "fail" : "pass");
