Exercise 4.9: Explain the behavior of the condition in the following if:

	const char *cp = "Hello World";
	if (cp && *cp)

By Faisal Saadatmand

The if statement evaluates if the value of the pointer cp is not zero AND that
the value it points to is not the null character '\0'. The former test checks
whether or not cp is a valid pointer (points to a valid memory address), while
the latter checks if cp points to the end of a c-style string (or to an empty
string). 

Both tests will pass: cp is valid because it points to a const char *, and that
the value of the object it points to is the beginning address of the string
literal, which is the character 'H'.

The if statement uses the short-circuit evaluation technique to make sure not
to dereference an invalid pointer--as it is an error to do so--before checking
the value cp points to.

Other verbose ways of writing this if statement:

	if (cp != 0 && *cp != '\0')
		/* ... */

	OR

	if (cp != NULL && *cp != '\0')
		/* ... */

	OR

	if (cp != nullptr && *cp != '\0') // preferred
		/* ... */
