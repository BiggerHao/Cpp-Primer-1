Exercise 4.25: What is the value of ~'q' << 6 on a machine with 32-bit ints and
8 bit chars, that uses Latin-1 character set in which 'q' has the bit pattern
01110001?

By Faisal Saadatmand

In the expression ~'q' << 6, after the bitwise NOT is evaluated the bitwise
left-shift operator will perform an implicit conversion, whereby the result of
~'q' is promoted to a signed int (since 6 is of type signed int). (p. 152, 160)

	~'q' returns 0x8e

	0xffffff8e << 6; // converted to a signed int

Given that shifting a signed number is implementation dependent the expression
invokes undefined behaviour. (p. 153)

That said, on this machine the result is

	0xffffe380 or 1111 1111 1111 1111 1110 0011 1000 0000
