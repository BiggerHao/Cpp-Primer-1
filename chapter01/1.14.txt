Exercise 1.14: Compare and contrast the loops that used a for with those using
a while. Are there advantages or disadvantages to using either form?

By Faisal Saadatmand

Both loops provide a way to make a conditional jump from a specific point in
the program to another. The main difference is syntactical. The while loop
takes only a loop_condition and iterate through its body while condition is
true. The for loop takes an initial_expression, a loop_condition, and a
loop_expression and iterates through its body until the lop_condition is no
longer true. The initial_expression is evaluated only once (at the beginning of
the first iteration) while the loop_expression is evaluated at every iteration
after the initial iteration is completed. All the parameters in the for loop
are optional.

Usually, the choice of which loop to use is a matter of preference. That said,
the while loop is better suited for simple loops. The for loop, on the other
hand, could increase readability when dealing with more complex loops, given
that it is more succinct but more informative in its definition.
