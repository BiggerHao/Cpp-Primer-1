Exercise 15.2: How does the protected access specifier differ from private?

By Faisal Saadatmand

The private specifier restricts access to a class' members. Only member
functions of the same class or friends of the class is granted access to
private members. This restriction applies to derived classes as well--a derived
class cannot access the base class' private members.  The protected specifier
allows derived classes to access its private members while still "protecting"
it from public access. Another way of looking at it, is that protected
maintains the concept of encapsulation in context of class inheritance.
