Exercise 15.21: Choose one of the following general abstractions containing a
family of types (or choose one of your own). Organize the types into an
inheritance hierarchy:

	(a) Graphical file formats (such as gif, tiff, jpeg, bmp)
	(b) Geometric primitives (such as box, circle, sphere, cone)
	(c) C++ language types (such as class, function, member function)

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) These types are not related by inheritance. That is to say that they do not
	inherit from one another. However, they all share a common property: they
	are files, more specifically they are graphical files. Therefore, the
	hierarchy could look some thing like the following:

File_base - base class 
Graphical_file - abstract class (derived from file_base)
Giff, Tiff, Jpeg and Bmp - classes (derived from Graphical_file)
