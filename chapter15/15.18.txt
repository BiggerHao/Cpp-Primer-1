Exercise 15.18: Given the classes from page 612 and page 613, and assuming each
object has the type specified in the comments, determine which of these
assignments are legal. Explain why those that are illegal arenâ€™t allowed:

	Base *p = &d1; // d1 has type Pub_Derv
	p = &d2; // d2 has type Priv_Derv
	p = &d3; // d3 has type Prot_Derv
	p = &dd1; // dd1 has type Derived_from_Public
	p = &dd2; // dd2 has type Derived_from_Private
	p = &dd3; // dd3 has type Derived_from_Protected

By Faisal Saadatmand

	p = &d2; // d2 has type Priv_Derv
	Illegal: users (objects) of Prive_derv are restricted by the private
	deriviation access specifier. d2 is a user of Priv_Derv, and therefore,
	cannot use derived-to-base conversion.

	p = &d3; // d3 has type Prot_Derv
	Illegal: users (objects) of Prive_Derv are restricted by the private
	deriviation access specifier. d3 is a user of Prot_Derv, and therefore, it
	cannot use derived-to-base conversion.

	p = &dd2; // dd2 has type Derived_from_Private
	Illegal: dd2 cannot use the derived-to-base conversion because it inherits
	public members of base through Priv_dev as private.

	p = &dd3; // dd3 has type Derived_from_Protected
	Illegal: add3 cannot use the derived-to-base conversion because it inherits
	public members of base through Priv_dev as protected.
