Exercise 15.10: Recalling the discussion from ยง 8.1 (p. 311), explain how the
program on page 317 that passed an ifstream to the Sales_data read function
works.

By Faisal Saadatmand

The declaration of the read function takes a reference to istream,

std::istream& read(std::istream &, Sales_data &);

We can pass a reference to ifstream to read because ifstream is a derived class
of istream. Inside of read, we can use members of istream with ifstream as we
would with istream because those members are dynamically bound.
