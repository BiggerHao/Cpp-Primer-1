Exercise 15.19: Assume that each of the classes from page 612 and page 613 has
a member function of the form:

	void memfcn(Base &b) { b = *this; }

For each class, determine whether this function would be legal.

By Faisal Saadatmand

Base		legal: because &b and *this types match
Pub_Derv	legal: derived-to base conversion is allowed regardless of
			derivation access specifier (p. 613)
Priv_Derv	legal: the same
Prot_Derv	legal: the same
Derived_from_Public		legal: the class inherits publicly from Pub_Derv
Derived_from_Private	illegal: the class inherits privately from Priv_Derv
Derived_from_Protected	legal: the class inherits protectively from Prot_Derv

Refer to Accessibility of Derived-to-Base Conversion (p. 613-614).
