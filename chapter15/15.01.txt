Exercise 15.1: What is a virtual member?

By Faisal Saadatmand

Is a member function that is defined by the base class. Unlike ordinary member
functions--which are inherited without change--a virtual function can, and is
expected, to be overridden by the derived class. Designating a function as
virtual allows us to distinguish between those operations that are common from
those that are specific to inherited class'. An important characteristic of a
virtual function is that its call, if done through a reference or a pointer, is
dynamically bound. This means that "[d]epending on the type of the object to
which the reference or pointer is bound, the version in the base class or in
one of its derived classes will be executed." (p. 595) As such, a virtual
functions is evaluated at runtime, as opposed to member functions that are
evaluated at compile time.
