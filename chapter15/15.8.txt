Exercise 15.8: Define static type and dynamic type.

By Faisal Saadatmand

A static type is the type of a variable or expression that is known at compile
time. "It is the type with which a variable is declared or that an expression
yields. The dynamic type is the type of the object in memory that the variable
or expression represents." (p. 601) It is not know until runtime. Another way
of putting it is that a static type is the declared type, which is 'locked'
during compilation, and the dynamic type is the actual type of a variable or
expression at runtime. An expression that is neither a reference or a pointer
will always have the same dynamic type as its static type, while a reference or
a pointer might have a different dynamic type than its static type at runtime.
