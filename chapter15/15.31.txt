Exercise 15.31: Given that s1, s2, s3, and s4 are all strings, determine what
objects are created in the following expressions:

	(a) Query(s1) | Query(s2) & ~ Query(s3);
	(b) Query(s1) | (Query(s2) & ~ Query(s3));
	(c) (Query(s1) & (Query(s2)) | (Query(s3) & Query(s4)));

By Faisal Saadatmand

Each operator creates a Query objects that is bound to its corresponds class
(derived from base_class) and Query generates a WordQuery object. (p. 638)

	|	creates a Query bound to a new OrQuery
	&	creates a Query bound to a new AndQuery
	~	creates Query bound to a new NotQuery
	Query creates a new WordQuery

Note: operator precedence follow the built-in operator precedence. (p. 635)

(a) OrQuery, AndQuery, NotQuery and 2 WordQuery objects.
(b) The same as a.
(c) OrQuery, 2 AndQuery and 4 WordQuery objects
