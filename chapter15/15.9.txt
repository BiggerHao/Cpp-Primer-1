Exercise 15.9: When is it possible for an expressionâ€™s static type to differ
from its dynamic type? Give three examples in which the static and dynamic type
differ.

By Faisal Saadatmand

When the expression is a reference or a pointer.

a) When we pass an expression to a function by reference or pointer
	Bulk_quote item;
	void f(Quote &);
	f(&item);

b) When we point a pointer to a base class to a derived class object
	Bulk_quote item;
	Quote *p = item;

c) When we refer to a derived class type using a reference to a base class type
	Bulk_quote item;
	Quote& q = item;

Bonus: when using a dynamic_cast or a static_cast. (p. 602)
