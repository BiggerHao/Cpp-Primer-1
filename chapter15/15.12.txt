Exercise 15.12: Is it ever useful to declare a member function as both override
and final? Why or why not?

Yes. It can be useful if we wished to stop a virtual function from being
inherited from a specific derived class. In other words, we could use override
and final to set an end point to a specific inheritance path for given virtual
function in the hierarchy.
