Exercise 15.37: What changes would your classes need if the derived classes had
members of type shared_ptr<Query_base> rather than of type Query?

By Faisal Saadatmand

1) The constructor AndQuery, OrQuery and NotQuery parameters' types must be
changed from Query to shared_ptr<Query_base>

2) The overloaded operators, with the exception of <<, parameters' or return
value must be change from type Query to shared_ptr<Query_base>

3) All the calls to rep and eval must use the -> access member operator
instead of the "." Member access operator.

4) The virtual function rep in Query_base has to be public, otherwise it will
not be accessible through dereferencing the shared_ptr<Query_base> within the
derived classes. Alternatively, we could have the derived classes befriend
Query_base. Note: protected access specifier will not work, because ...

5) Query class must define a conversion operator (with a public access
specifier) from Query to shared_ptr<Query_base>

6) Query's constructor must be public in order to be accessible to users.

See 15.37a.cpp for an implementation.
