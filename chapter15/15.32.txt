Exercise 15.32: What happens when an object of type Query is copied, moved, as
signed, and destroyed?

By Faisal Saadatmand

Query has a synthesized copy-control operations. When it is copied, moved, and
assigned the appropriate synthesized operation will memberwise copy, move or
assign its data members. Query has only one data member q, which is a
shared_ptr.  As smart pointer, q would adjusts its reference counter according
to the effect of the copy-control operation on it.

When a Query object is destroyed, Query's destructor will run the shared_ptr
q's destructor. If q's reference counter is 0, a virtual call to the destructor
of Query_base will be made that will run the appropriate derived class'
destructor based on the dynamic type q.
