Exercise 15.25: Why did we define a default constructor for Disc_quote? What
effect, if any, would removing that constructor have on the behavior of
Bulk_quote?

By Faisal Saadatmand

Because Disc_quote defines another constructor (one that takes 4 parameter) the
compiler will not generate a synthesized default constructor for it. (p.263)
Removing the defined default constructor would mean that Disc_quote will have
an implicitly deleted default constructor. This would not have any effect on
Disc_quote directly, since we cannot create an object of Dis_quote type anyway.
(p. 610) However, its derived classes will also have a deleted default
constructor. (p. 624) As a result, we would not be able default initialize (p.
293) objects of type Bulk_quote. For example, the code Bulk_quote obj; would be
erroneous.
