Exercise 15.2: How does the protected access specifier differ from private?

By Faisal Saadatmand

The private specifier restricts access to the class members. Only member
functions of the same class or friends of the class is granted access to
private members. This restriction applies to derived classes as well--a derived
class cannot access the base class private members. The protected specifier
allows derived classes to access the base class private members while still
"protecting" them from public access. In short, protected maintains the concept
of encapsulation in context of class inheritance.
