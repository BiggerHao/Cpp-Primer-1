Exercise 15.23: Assuming class D1 on page 620 had intended to override its
inherited fcn function, how would you fix that class? Assuming you fixed the
class so that fcn matched the definition in Base, how would the calls in that
section be resolved?

By Faisal Saadatmand

class base {
	public:
		virtual
};

class D1 : public Base {
	public:
		int fcn();  // override the virtual function
		int fcn(int);
		virtual void f2();
};

To fix the class, D1 must override the virttual fcn from base. This will
resolve all calls in that sections except one:
	
	Base *p1 = &d2obj;
	p1->fcn(42);

This is so because fcn(int) is not a virtual function. The name lookup uses the
static type to call the member function fcn(in). In this case, it is of type
Base. Thus, the compiler would still generate an error because class Base has
no version of fcn(int).
