Exercise 15.23: Assuming class D1 on page 620 had intended to override its
inherited fcn function, how would you fix that class? Assuming you fixed the
class so that fcn matched the definition in Base, how would the calls in that
section be resolved?

By Faisal Saadatmand

To fix the class, fcn(int) should take no parameter or be renamed to something
else. This will ensure that D1's fcn() is not hidden and that it overrides the
virtual fcn() from Base class.
