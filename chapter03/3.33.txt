Exercise 3.33: What would happen if we did not initialize the scores array in
the program on page 116?

By Faisal Saadatmand

The compiler will not complain, because the scores array will be default
initialized, which means the values of its elements will be zeros if it is
declared as a global object or undefined (garbage values) if it is declared
locally. The latter case would cause the algorithm to produce undefined values
at instruction ++scores[grade/10];.
