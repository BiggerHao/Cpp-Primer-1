Exercise 3.11: Is the following range for legal? If so, what is the type of c?

	const string s = "Keep out!";
	for (auto &c : s) { /* ... */ }

By Faisal Saadatmand

Legal: auto-deduced type. The auto specifier will deduce the type const char &
for c; however, this coult potentially pose an issue: if the expression inside
the range loop attempted to assign/re-assign a value to c, the compiler will
reject it because c is a const. It is good practice to be explicit and use
const auto &c instead.
