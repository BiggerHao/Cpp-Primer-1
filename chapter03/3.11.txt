Exercise 3.11: Is the following range for legal? If so, what is the type of c?

	const string s = "Keep out!";
	for (auto &c : s) { /* ... */ }

By Faisal Saadatmand

Legal: auto-deduced type. The auto specifier will deduce type const char & for
c; however; this potentially poses an issue, if the expression inside the range
loop attempted to assign/re-assign a value to c. The compiler will reject it.
