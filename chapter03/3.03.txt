Exercise 3.3: Explain how whitespace characters are handled in the string input
operator and in the getline function.

By Faisal Saadatmand

In the string input operator leading whitespaces are skipped (ignored) and
trailing whitespace is discarded.

In getline function all whitespaces are copied to the string except the newline
character that end the line, which is discarded.
