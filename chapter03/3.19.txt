Exercise 3.19: List three ways to define a vector and give it ten elements,
each with the value 42. Indicate whether there is a preferred way to do so and
why.

By Faisal Saadatmand

(1) vector<int> ivec(10, 42);
(2) vector<int> ivec = {42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42 ,42};
(3) vector<int> ivec;
	for (decltype(ivec.size()) i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
		ivec.push_back(42);

1 is preferred b because  more concise and easier to read, especially since the
size of the vector is known before hand and every value in the vector is the
same.
