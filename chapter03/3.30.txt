Exercise 3.30: Identify the indexing errors in the following code:

	constexpr size_t array_size = 10;
	int ia[array_size];
	for (size_t ix = 1; ix <= array_size; ++ix)
	ia[ix] = ix;

By Faisal Saadatmand

The for loop triggers a buffer overflow, because it indexes 1 element beyond
the array's dimensions. Array indexing starts at 0 and ends at the array's size
- 1. In the above case, that would be 0 to 9, but the loop's condition allows
the indexing subscript 10.  If the intention were to iterate over each element
of ia, the for loop should be rewritten as follows:

for (size_t ix = 0; ix < array_size; ++ix)
	...
