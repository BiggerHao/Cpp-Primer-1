Exercise 3.38: In this section, we noted that it was not only illegal but meaningless to
try to add two pointers. Why would adding two pointers be meaningless?

A pointer is an integer (size is implementation dependent) whose value is an
address to a location in memory. Thus, adding two pointers is adding the
addresses of two memory locations, which would result in an invalid address
location.
