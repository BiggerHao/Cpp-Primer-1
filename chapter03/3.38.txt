Exercise 3.38: In this section, we noted that it was not only illegal but meaningless to
try to add two pointers. Why would adding two pointers be meaningless?

A pointer is integer (size depends on the machine) whose value is an address to
a location in memory. Thus, adding two pointers is equivalent to adding two
memory address which results in a meaningless number.
