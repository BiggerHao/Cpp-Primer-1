Exercise 3.9: What does the following program do? Is it valid? If not, why not?

	string s;
	cout << s[0] << endl;

By Faisal Saadatmand

Declare s of type string. S is default initialized, i.e. undefined. Print s at
subscript/index 0. Print newline character.

It is valid; however, indexing an uninitialized string leads to undefined
behaviour...a very bad, bad thing!
