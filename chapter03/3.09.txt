Exercise 3.9: What does the following program do? Is it valid? If not, why not?

	string s;
	cout << s[0] << endl;

By Faisal Saadatmand

According to the string class' definition, default initializing s will return
an empty string, i.e. a string that contains no characters except for the null
character '\0'.

Thus, s[0] will return the null character '\0'. Given that it is a
non-graphical character, cout will not print it.

Although the above is a valid C++ code, modifying s[0] will cause undefined
behaviour. Moreover, it is considered good practice to initialize objects
explicitly, as opposed to relaying on the class' default initialization.
