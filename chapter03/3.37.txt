Exercise 3.37: What does the following program do?

	const char ca[] = {’h’, ’e’, ’l’, ’l’, ’o’};
	const char *cp = ca;
	while (*cp) {
		cout << *cp << endl;
		++cp;
	}

By Faisal Saadatmand

The program prints the string "hello" one character at a time, each on a
separate line. Note: ca is not null terminated. This could potentially trigger
a buffer overflow error. If you're lucky, as I was not when testing this code,
the element one passed the end of ca is NOT a null character which would alert
you to the problem. Otherwise, the loop will terminate as expected without any
apparent issue. This makes such an error hard to debug.
