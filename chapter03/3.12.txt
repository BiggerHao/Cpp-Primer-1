For those that are legal, explain what the definition does. For those that are
not legal, explain why they are illegal.

	(a) vector<vector<int>> ivec;
	(b) vector<string> svec = ivec;
	(c) vector<string> svec(10, "null");

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) legal: ivec is a verctor of vector of int.
(b) ilegal: svec elements of type string while ivec of type vector.
(c) legal: svec is a vector whose elements of type string, which holds 10
