Exercise 3.27: Assuming txt_size is a function that takes no arguments and
returns an int value, which of the following definitions are illegal? Explain
why.

	unsigned buf_size = 1024;
	(a) int ia[buf_size];
	(b) int ia[4 * 7 - 14];
	(c) int ia[txt_size()];
	(d) char st[11] = "fundamental";

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) Illegal: buf_size is not a constexpr.
(b) legal: subscript is a constexpr evaluated at compile time.
(c) legal if text_size() is a constexpr otherwise illegal.
(d) Illegal: dimension must be at least 12. 11 + 1 for null character.
