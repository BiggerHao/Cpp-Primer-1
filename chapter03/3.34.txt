Exercise 3.34: Given that p1 and p2 point to elements in the same array, what
does the following code do? Are there values of p1 or p2 that make this code
illegal?

	p1 += p2 - p1;

By Faisal Saadatmand

Find the distance between p1 and p2 and add it to p1. Essentially, this code
moves p1 to the position of p2. Provided that both pointers point to memory
locations within the boundaries of the same array (or 1 past the last element)
, the code will always be legal.
