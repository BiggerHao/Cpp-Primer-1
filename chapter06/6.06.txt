Exercise 6.6: Explain the differences between a parameter, a local variable,
and a local static variable. Give an example of a function in which each might
be useful.

By Faisal Saadatmand

A parameter defines the number and type of argument a function might take. It
is part of a function's declaration.

A local variable is an automatic object, which is defined and initialized
through the function's parameters or in the function's body. Its scope is
limited to the function's call. In other words, it is created when the function
is called and destroyed when the function returns.

A static variable is an object that is defined within the function's body. It,
too, is local in scope variable; however, it is initialized once only, when the
function is called for the first time, and its value persists until it is
reassigned by a subsequent call.
