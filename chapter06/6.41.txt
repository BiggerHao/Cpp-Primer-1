Exercise 6.41: Which, if any, of the following calls are illegal? Why? Which,
if any, are legal but unlikely to match the programmerâ€™s intent? Why?

	char *init(int ht, int wd = 80, char bckgrnd = ' ');
	(a) init();
	(b) init(24, 10);
	(c) init(14, '*');

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) Illegal: ht has no default value. Its argument must be provided in the call.
(b) Legal
(c) Legal but likely does not match the programmer's intent: the character '*'
	was probably meant to change the default value of the parameter bckgrnd.
