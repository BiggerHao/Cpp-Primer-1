Exercise 6.37: Write three additional declarations for the function in the
previous exercise. One should use a type alias, one should use a trailing
return, and the third should use decltype. Which form do you prefer and why?

By Faisal Saadatmand

// raw syntax
std::string (&func())[10]

// type alias
using arrT = std::string[10];
arrT &func();

// trailing return
auto func() -> std::string (&)[10];

// decltype
std::string array[10];
decltype(array) &func();

All of them seem to be equally confusing. Just pick one convection and stick
with it. That said, I particularly dislike decltype declaration because it
requires the parameters to be declared as global variables.
