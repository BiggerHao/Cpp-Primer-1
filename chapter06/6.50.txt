Exercise 6.50: Given the declarations for f from page 242, list the viable
functions, if any for each of the following calls. Indicate which function is
the best match, or if the call is illegal whether there is no match or why the
call is ambiguous.

	(a) f(2.56, 42)
	(b) f(42)
	(c) f(42, 0)
	(d) f(2.56, 3.14)

By Faisal Saadatmand

Candidate functions:
	void f();
	void f(int);
	void f(int, int);
	void f(double, double = 3.14);

(a) ambiguous: both f(int, int) and f(double, double = 3.14) are viable
	functions; however, neither is an overall "best match" because both have one
	parameter that is an exact match of the argument passed and one that is a match
	through a built-in conversion, a "lesser" match.
(b) f(int) is the best match from the candidate functions. It has the same
	number of parameters as the argument passed and the exact match of its type.
(c) f(int, int) is the best match.
(d) f(double, double = 3.14) is a best match.
