Exercise 6.2: Indicate which of the following functions are in error and why.
Suggest how you might correct the problems.
	(a) int f() {
			string s;
			// . . .
			return s;
		}
	(b) f2(int i) { /* . . . */ }
	(c) int calc(int v1, int v1) /* . . . */ }
	(d) double square(double x) return x * x;

(a) s should be declared as a parameter, otherwise f would return a refrence
	(or a pointer) to a string that will be destroyed after the function's call has
	ended.
		int f(string &s) {
				// ...
				return s;
		}
(b) Must explicitly specify that f2 returns no value in the definition.
	void f2 (int i) { /* . . . */ }
(c) ok
(d) ok
