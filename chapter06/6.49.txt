Exercise 6.49: What is a candidate function? What is a viable function?

By Faisal Saadatmand

A candidate function is an overloaded function whose name is identified by the
compiler as match of the name of a given function call. A viable function is a
candidate function that has the same number of parameters as the number of
arguments passed in function call of an overloaded function.
