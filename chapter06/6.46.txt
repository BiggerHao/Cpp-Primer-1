Exercise 6.46: Would it be possible to define isShorter as a constexpr? If so,
do so. If not, explain why not.

By Faisal Saadatmand

No, because the values returned by s1.size() and s2.size() are known only at
runtime. As such they are not constexpr.

To verify:

	constexpr bool isShorter(const std::string &s1, const std::string &s2)
	constexpr bool result = isShorter(str1, str2);  // error
