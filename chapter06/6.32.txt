Exercise 6.32: Indicate whether the following function is legal. If so, explain
what it does; if not, correct any errors and then explain it.

	int &get(int *arry, int index) { return arry[index]; }
	int main() {
		int ia[10];
		for (int i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
			get(ia, i) = i;
	}

Legal: get returns a reference to an int, which is a reference to the element
in the array 'arry' at index 'index'. This return value is an lvalue, which
means it can be used in the left-hand side of an assignment operator.
