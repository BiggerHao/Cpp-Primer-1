Exercise 6.35: In the call to factorial, why did we pass val - 1 rather than
val--?

Because the postfix decrement operator yields an unchanged value of its operand
, and thereafter, increments it. This means the value of val will be unmodified
on each recursive call, which would lead to an infinite recursion.

Using the prefix decrement to solve the recursion issue is equally problematic
because it would have a side effect on the value of val on the right-hand side
of the multiplication operator when the function returns. The side effect could
be demonstrated as follows:

	<returned value from recursive call> * val - 1;
