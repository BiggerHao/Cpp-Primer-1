Exercise 6.34: What would happen if the stopping condition in factorial were

	if (val != 0)

By Faisal Saadatmand

The recursion would work fine for 0 and positive integers. However, if we
mistakenly passed a negative integer to factorial, val != 0 will not terminate
the recursion (and return 1); it will keep going until the stack is overflown.
Since the factorial of a negative number is undefined we should use val > 1
instead.
