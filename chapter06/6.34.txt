Exercise 6.34: What would happen if the stopping condition in factorial were

	if (val != 0)

By Faisal Saadatmand

Same recursion would occur, because (val != 0) is the same as (val < 1), as
long as val is a positive integer. If ever the parameter to the recursive call
of factorial change to produce a negative value of val, the recursion will not
stop.
