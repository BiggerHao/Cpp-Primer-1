Exercise 6.1: What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

By Faisal Saadatmand

A parameter is a constituent part of a function's definition. It is the part
that defines the number and type of argument(s) a function call might take. In
the function's definition (or declaration) it comes after the function's name
and is enclosed inside parentheses. A function could also have a void
parameter, i.e. no take no arguments.

An argument is the initializer for a function's parameter. When a function is
called, through the call operator (), an argument or a list of arguments is
passed through it to initialize the value of it's parameters. All
initialization are local in scope and last the lifetime of the function. The
type and number of arguments must match the type and number of arguments of the
parameters used to define the function.
