Exercise 6.13: Assuming T is the name of a type, explain the difference between
a function declared as void f(T) and void f(T&).

By Faisal Saadatmand

void f(T) is a pass by value function that copies an object of type T locally
and uses it as its argument, while void f(T&) is pass by reference function
that accepts a reference to a type T object as its argument, no copying is
involved.
