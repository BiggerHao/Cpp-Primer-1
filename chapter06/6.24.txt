Exercise 6.24: Explain the behavior of the following function. If there are
problems in the code, explain what they are and how you might fix them.

	void print(const int ia[10])
	{
		for (size_t i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
		cout << ia[i] << endl;
	}

By Faisal Saadatmand

The function prints the all 10 elements of ia. The parameter is wrong, because
if we passed a smaller array to print, the for loop will overstep the array's
bounds. Since this version of print seems to be intended to print arrays of
ints that are exactly of size 10, ia should be a reference to an array of 10
const int. This will limit the acceptable arguments to the desired type of
arrays.

correction:

	void print(const int (&ia)[10])
	{
		for (size_t i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
		cout << ia[i] << endl;
	}
