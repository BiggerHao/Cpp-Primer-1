Exercise 6.24: Explain the behavior of the following function. If there are
problems in the code, explain what they are and how you might fix them.

	void print(const int ia[10])
	{
		for (size_t i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
		cout << ia[i] << endl;
	}

By Faisal Saadatmand

The function prints the first 10 elements of ia. The parameter is
wrong, because if a smaller array is passed the loop will overstep the array's
bounds. ia should be a reference to an array of 10 const int. This will limit
the acceptable size to 10 only.
correction:

	void print(const int (&ia)[10])
	{
		for (size_t i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
		cout << ia[i] << endl;
	}
