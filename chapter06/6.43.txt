Exercise 6.43: Which one of the following declarations and definitions would you put
in a header? In a source file? Explain why.

	(a) inline bool eq(const BigInt&, const BigInt&) {...}
	(b) void putValues(int *arr, int size);

By Faisal Saadatmand

Both a and b should be put in a header. In the case of a, eq is an inline
function that is expanded at compile time. "Unlike other functions,
inline...functions may be defined multiple times in the program" (p. 240) All
of the definition of an inline function must match exactly. The compiler would
need the definition in order able to expand the function; not just the
declaration. In the case of b, putValues is a declaration of a normal function,
which should be put into a header so the compiler could see. Thereafter, it is
the job of the linker, not the compiler, to link the declaration with the
definition.
