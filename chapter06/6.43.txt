Exercise 6.43: Which one of the following declarations and definitions would you put
in a header? In a source file? Explain why.

	(a) inline bool eq(const BigInt&, const BigInt&) {...}
	(b) void putValues(int *arr, int size);

Declaration a, because it is an inline function which is expanded at compile
time.
