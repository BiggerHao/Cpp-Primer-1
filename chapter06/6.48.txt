Exercise 6.48: Explain what this loop does and whether it is a good use of
assert:

	string s;
	while (cin >> s && s != sought) { } // empty body
	assert(cin);

By Faisal Saadatmand

The loop keeps executing while there is a valid string input from the user AND
that such a string does not match the sought after string. The call to the
assert macro checks if cin is still in good state after the loop. This is not a
good use of assert because if a match is not found and the input has reached
the EOF (quite common), cin will return 0, which will make the assert fail.
