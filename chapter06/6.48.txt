Exercise 6.48: Explain what this loop does and whether it is a good use of
assert:

	string s;
	while (cin >> s && s != sought) { } // empty body
	assert(cin);

By Faisal Saadatmand

The loop executes while there is a string input from the user AND the sought
string has not been entered yet. Given that the loop's body is empty, the
condition will always hold true unless there is NO INPUT from the user--the
expression (s != sought) will NEVER be true. The assert macro checks if there
was an input after the termination of the loop. This assert condition "cannot
happen"; therefore, it is a good use of assert, even though the practicality of
the code seems questionable to me.
