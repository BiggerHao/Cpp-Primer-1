Exercise 6.14: Give an example of when a parameter should be a reference type.
Give an example of when a parameter should not be a reference.

By Faisal Saadatmand

Whenever we are passing a large object to a function we should use pass by
reference to avoid the overhead of copying. When need to perform changes to a
parameter without changing the original value of the argument passed, we should
use pass by value.
