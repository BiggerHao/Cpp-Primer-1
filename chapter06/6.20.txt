Exercise 6.20: When should reference parameters be references to const? What
happens if we make a parameter a plain reference when it could be a reference
to const?

By Faisal Saadatmand

Unless we must change the object being passed through the reference, reference
parameters should be references to const. This allows us to pass a reference to
a non- as well as a const as the function argument. If we used a plain
reference as a parameter, then we could only pass a nonconst reference.
