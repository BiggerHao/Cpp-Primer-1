Exercise 6.52: Given the following declarations,

	void manip(int, int);
	double dobj;

what is the rank (ยง 6.6.1, p. 245) of each conversion in the following calls?

	(a) manip('a', 'z');
	(b) manip(55.4, dobj);

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) Match through promotion: char to int -- top-level const is discarded.
(b) Match through arithmetic conversion (implicit): double to int for both arguments.
