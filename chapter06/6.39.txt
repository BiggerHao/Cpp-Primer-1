Exercise 6.39: Explain the effect of the second declaration in each one of the
following sets of declarations. Indicate which, if any, are illegal.

	(a) int calc(int, int);
		int calc(const int, const int);
	(b) int get();
		double get();
	(c) int *reset(int *);
		double *reset(double *);

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) Illegal: overloading a function with the same type and number of
	parameters--top-level const is ignored.
(b) Illegal: cannot overloading a function with differing return value.
(c) legal: overloading reset with differing type parameter: a pointer to
	an int and a pointer to a double. Note, however, that the parameters' types
	are related by conversion, which may lead to ambiguous calls if reset had
	more than one parameter. See 6.6 Function Matching (p. 242).
