Exercise 6.39: Explain the effect of the second declaration in each one of the
following sets of declarations. Indicate which, if any, are illegal.

	(a) int calc(int, int);
		int calc(const int, const int);
	(b) int get();
		double get();
	(c) int *reset(int *);
		double *reset(double *);

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) Illegal: overloading a function with the same type and number of
	parameters--top-level const is ignored.
(b) Illegal: cannot overloading a function with differing return value.
(c) legal: overloading reset with differing type parameter (from a pointer to
	an int to a pointer to a double); however, it is ambiguous because the
	parameters are related by conversion.
