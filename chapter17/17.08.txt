Exercise 17.8: What would happen if we passed Sales_data() as the third
parameter to accumulate in the last code example in this section?

By Faisal Saadatmand

The starting point (i.e. value) for the accumulate algorithm would be an empty
object of type Sales_data. Given that the + operator of Sales_data ignores the
string data member of the object, accumulate would return an object with the
proper calculation performed for the particular book but leaves the bookNo
variable untouched, i.e. leaves it as an empty string.
