Exercise 17.9: Explain the bit pattern each of the following bitset objects contains:

	(a) bitset<64> bitvec(32);
	(b) bitset<32> bv(1010101);
	(c) string bstr; cin >> bstr; bitset<8>bv(bstr);

By Faisal Saadatmand

(a) bitvec is initialized with 32ULL--the integral value 32 is implicitly
	converted to unsigned long long (p. 732). bit 0 to 5 will have the pattern
	1 0000 (32 in base 10) and the rest of the bits till bit 63 will be 0.

(b) 1010101 (base 10) is F69B5 (base 16), which is at least 20 bits.
	Initializing bv with F69b5 will set the lower-order bits to 1111 0110 1001
	1011 0101 and bits 21 to 31 to 0.
(c) bv will be initialized from the string bstr, which is initiated from the
	standard input. If bstr size is less than 8, the remaining higher order
	bits will be set to 0. If its size is bigger than 8, the extra bits will be
	discarded.
