Exercise 17.7: Explain which version of findBook you prefer and why.

By Faisal Saadatmand

In this example, we needed to return multiple values from findBook. Here, a
tuple makes most sense--a pair would suffice too, though it is less suitable
for the task. With a tuple we can create a temporary "structure" to hold data
of different types, which we could then store into our vector of vectors.
Thereafter, the "structure" is not needed and would be disposed of.

That said, if we intended to use the tuple more often in our code, it is best
to have used a dedicated struct. The advantage of struct over a tuple (or a
pair) is that it makes the code easier to read, extend and maintain.
